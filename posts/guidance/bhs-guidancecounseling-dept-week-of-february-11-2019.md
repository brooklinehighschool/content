**IMPORTANT NOTE RE: WHO IS RECEIVING BHS GUIDANCE UPDATES-**  
From Darby Neff-Verre, Guidance Department Chair:  Aspen X2 is the communication tool available for sending the weekly BHS Guidance Update emails. I send these emails to all students (based on the email address in X2 which is now only their brookilnek12 address) and **the first contact listed on Aspen**. If I add other Aspen contacts, then this automatically sends weekly emails to ALL of a single student's contacts, including emergency contacts. In the effort to not flood emails of people who don't need this information, I have only been sending to the first contact listed for every student. **I ask that parents / co-parents/ guardians share these emails with each other so important info is presented to all.**

**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS**  
   
**Friday Lunch Lounge continues!**   
Want a different place to eat lunch? Many students are enjoying a less stressful, fun experience in a quiet, small venue.  
You are invited to come to room 277 on Fridays to hangout, play games, and meet some new people. Bring your lunch or enjoy some delicious pizza.  
We are looking forward to meeting you!  
IMPORTANT UPDATE: We are working hard to expand these well-received social lunch opportunities to other lunches during the school week. More information to come….

 **BHS specific, General and BU, Northeastern Scholarship Info**:  
More details available on the BHS homepage and the BHS Guidance website noted above.  
The Brookline High Scholarship Committee would like parents to know that we use three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, unmet financial need. There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.   
Specific applications are now available for tuition scholarships to Boston University (2 full-tuition renewable scholarships) and Northeastern University (2 half-tuition renewable scholarships). Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2019 BHS Scholarship Application. Applications must be completed ASAP.   
The deadline for applying for all BHS scholarships for students attending ANY OTHER college is April 1. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code #0424. Please use the same application as above.  
   
**“Is it a Scam?” – Scholarship and other financial aid scams - Federal Trade Commission** - [**http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0082-scholarship-and-financial-aid-scams**](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0082-scholarship-and-financial-aid-scams)   
Beware of scholarship and other financial aid scams! This website can help you spot scams and avoid wasting your money.  
    
**READ YOUR EMAIL IF YOU HAVE APPLIED TO COLLEGE!** **Set up and check your portal for each college. If you have questions, students should be contacting the admissions offices, not parents….. See this article for more info about documents to college -** [**http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2018/11/21/parents-before-you-yell-at-your-childs-school-counselor/**](http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2018/11/21/parents-before-you-yell-at-your-childs-school-counselor/)  
   
If you **change your admissions requests or decide not to apply to a college on your original transcript release form**, PLEASE NOTIFY YOUR COUNSELOR OR STOP BY ROOM 161 (Main Guidance Office) so we can update your requests.  
    
**Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college?** You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please see Kate Cordner, the BHS Career Counselor, on Tues- Friday in Room 279 or 280 for more info.
