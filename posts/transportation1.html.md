**Transportation**  
  
The Transportation Department coordinates regular pupil transportation for all eligible public school pupils who reside 1 1/2 miles or more in walking distance from their regular assigned school and all English Language Learner and Special Education transportation as approved by the School Committee or required by the State Department of Education.  Eastern Bus Company operates the four (4) yellow school buses for home to school, athletic, and field trips. YCN Transportation operates the in-town and out-of-town student services transportation.  In addition, YCN operates bus routes that are difficult to service with a yellow school bus.  
  
**South Brookline BHS Bus Info:**  
The new expanded transportation services for South Brookline High School Students does not continue the AM courtesy bus.   
Residents of the Baker and Heath School zones attending BHS are invited to participate in a fee based transportation service to and from BHS ($400 per student. The fee guarantees a seat on a school bus to and from school at a prescribed time). Participation will be first come first serve.   
The pickup and drop off times will be determined after registration is closed and we know how many students will be riding the bus. Bus stops are expected to cover those living in approximately a 0.34 mile radius or less.
