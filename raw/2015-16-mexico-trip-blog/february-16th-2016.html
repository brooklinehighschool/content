                  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;display:block;">¡Hola! It's Ceci (chica de cumpleaños #2) and Susanna here. We're going to tell you about Sunday, our first day, and our amazing, yet tiring, trip to Tepoztlán and the pyramid there. On Sunday morning, we got to sleep in, because we had arrived at one in the morning the night before. We had our first breakfast with our Mexican host family. It consisted of fresh tortillas with beans, salsa and eggs; delicious, freshly squeezed orange juice; and our first taste of Mexican sweet breads. After breakfast we headed over to the institute to meet the bus. After arriving in Tepoztlán, we walked for a little while to get to the downtown market. The first thing we noticed were the colors. It was so colorful there, and all of the vendors were selling vibrant home-made crafts, souvenirs, and street food. There were so many vendors! We walked through the market to get to the mountain that we were going to climb. From afar it looked scary tall and even scarier up close. The climb took two hours, with much heavy breathing and lots of resting points. When we finally reached the top, we were able to see the small pyramid that was built by the Aztecs many years ago. We looked out on the city from the top of the mountain and the sea of colorful houses seemed the size of cars. Then, when we were all resting on the very top of the pyramid, one of the tour guides told us all about the gods that were worshipped in this pyramid. The hike down was relieving and much easier than the hike up. It only took one hour. Once we'd returned to the ground, we went to get "Tepoz Nieves," or ice cream. There were many new flavors of ice cream that we had never seen/tasted before, including flavors such as rose, lime, cheese and more tropical fruits. It was a big relief after the long climb. After this, it was quite late and we returned to the bus and drove home. We were exhausted from such a fun day and so slept extremely well that night. All in all, the day was full and tiring, but extremely worth it. It was a great beginning to such an exciting two weeks.&nbsp;</div>
