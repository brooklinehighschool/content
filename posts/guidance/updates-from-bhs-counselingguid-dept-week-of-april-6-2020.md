		4/5/2020
	

The goal of the BHS Counseling/Guidance department and the school community overall is to encourage students to try their best in school while keeping their stress levels to a healthy level. This time with COVID19 challenges all of our stress levels, our patience, and our strength. There are important messages in this week’s update but the MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE TODAY IS **TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF! REACH OUT IF YOU NEED SUPPORT! BHS COUNSELORS AND OTHER STAFF ARE HERE FOR YOU… AT A DISTANCE BUT WITH AS MUCH CARE AS EVER! PLEASE DO NOT WORRY ALONE.  
​**  
Some BHS students are working to put together an easily accessible resource list for our social/ emotional well-being and basic needs. That resource will come soon. In the mean time, please check out the resources listed below and do not hesitate to contact your counselor, dean, or caring BHS adult. We are here to help and support every BHS student!  
   
**The Brookline High School’s United Mind Worker learning platform continues. Please go to the UMW page on the BHS homepage for information.**  
   
MA Dept of Mental Health: Maintaining Emotional Health & Well-Being During the COVID-19 Outbreak**Resources and tips to help boost emotional health and well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak.**  
Taking care of your emotional health and well-being during this time is important. [**Decreasing stress can help bolster your immune system**](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-happens-when-your-immune-system-gets-stressed-out/) and can help keep you and others around you healthy. Below are a list of resources and tips for staying emotionally healthy and well - [https://www.mass.gov/info-details/maintaining-emotional-health-well-being-during-the-covid-19-outbreak](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/maintaining-emotional-health-well-being-during-the-covid-19-outbreak)

**The Western Mass Recovery Learning Community (RLC) creates conditions that support healing and growth for individuals and the community as a whole through learning opportunities, advocacy, peer-to-peer support and the development of regional and national networks -** [http://www.westernmassrlc.org/hidden-community-happenings-fix/888-on-line-and-phone-supports-march-2020](http://www.westernmassrlc.org/hidden-community-happenings-fix/888-on-line-and-phone-supports-march-2020)  
**Our community is made up of many individuals including those who:**

*   Have experienced or are experiencing extreme emotional distress and/or psychiatric diagnoses
*   Are survivors of trauma
*   Are struggling with addictions and/or substance abuse
*   Have experienced discrimination or oppression as a result of psychiatric diagnosis and/or a variety of other reasons
*   Have a desire to find healing and growth for any part of their lives or being
*   Are allies or who have genuine interest in learning and/or adding to the community

**We approach our mission by:**

*   Offering trauma sensitive peer-to-peer supports
*   Fostering mutuality and connection building
*   Offering opportunities for learning and sharing of ideas
*   Advocating for change at individual and community levels
*   Developing regional and national networks

 We know how important it is to engage in healthy and preventative practices to support our emotional well being during this quarantine. One of our BHS social workers suggests…… **If you do reach out for your own outpatient therapy, many insurances are doing away with co-pays for this period of telehealth and phone appointments.**   
Depending on your insurance, there may be no co-pays **from quarantine dates of service (and possibly telehealth appointments after that)**. Take a moment to call your insurance company to check!  
   
**IMPORTANT - The student portal has closed. If you have not completed your elective and wellness course request, you can email your counselor until 4/10 (end of this week) so they can help you with this important task. If you have reached out to your counselor and not heard back yet, we are working on replying to everyone. Thank you for your patience!**  
**2020-21 Brookline High Course Catalog** [http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/bhscat\_20\_21\_final.pdf](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/bhscat_20_21_final.pdf)  
Keep in mind the required BHS course credits needed for graduation and talk with your parents-caretakers about the best course load balance for you.  
   
**BHS students who registered for AP tests - The AP Coordinators sent a message to all students earlier this week. More information to come from BHS in the near future.**

**It's time to think about your summer plans!**   
Please see the attached info sheet for many ideas (updated 3/8/20). Note that programs listed here are not all inclusive and do not suggest that Brookline High specifically endorses any program. Remember to read the intro at the top of the info sheet. See your counselor for more feedback or questions!  
Some **suggested summer pre-college opportunities** with financial aid available - [http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/](http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/)  
Please note that attending a pre-college program at any particular college does not usually offer any special consideration during future admissions at that school.  
   
Help your Brookline neighbor! See this message from **Brookline Strength in Distance** - We are a small group of Brookline-ites who got together to create the “Strength in Distance” fundraiser to support the Brookline Food Pantry. The food pantry receives and distributes more than 12,000 pounds of fresh produce, frozen items, dry goods, and hygiene products to our neighbors EACH WEEK and has just opened a third location to help meet demand.   
In order to ensure that all of us have the food we need to stay healthy and strong during this crisis, the Food Pantry needs your help! Please visit [brooklinestrengthindistance.com](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/LVTICL95JDiYB6w4iqICpT?domain=brooklinestrengthindistance.com) to purchase a “Strength in Distance” t-shirt to support the Brookline Food Pantry as well as a local print shop. Or, if you prefer, you can donate directly to the Brookline Food Pantry or the Brookline Community Foundation’s Safety Net Fund (linked on our site).   
If you know any students, friends or fellow community members who are in need of support in these difficult and uncertain times, please visit the [Brookline Mutual Aid Google Doc](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/WDKKCKr5QBsr7VMmfM1kUB?domain=docs.google.com) to get plugged into Brookline’s community services network. Feel free to send this message to other Brookline community members as well!  
Please reach out to [strengthindistance2020@gmail.com](mailto:strengthindistance2020@gmail.com) with any questions. Thank you for all of your hard work during these times!  
   
   
   
**SENIORS**  
**Koplik** - The MA Dept of Education (DESE) is reworking both expectations and deadlines for the Koplik Scholarship process. We should know more by later this week and that information will be shared with all seniors and their parents/guardians. I suggest holding on any Koplik specific action steps until we know more from DESE.  
**IMPORTANT REMINDER - Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2020 BHS Scholarship Application.** The deadline for applying for BHS scholarships for students attending ANY college is April 17. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code  #0424  
   
**Fallon Ambulance is excited to offer a full scholarship to up to 2 graduating students to participate in our EMT school!** EMT training is an amazing stepping stone and can lead to several healthcare career paths as well as provide a great foundation for college careers. Upon completion of the Massachusetts EMT Certification, recipients will be given the opportunity for full-time or part-time employment with Fallon or LifeLine Ambulance Service. Employment opportunities are subject to the candidates ability to successfully complete pre-hire requirements and EMT exams.  
Interested students need to submit this linked online application along with all required documents no later than April 10, 2020. All applications will be subject to review and will be released by May 1, 2020. Award certificates will be given directly to the recipient and notification will be sent out to the High School Guidance Department.

Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college? You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please email Kate Kennedy, the BHS Career for more info.  
   
**SENIORS AND JUNIORS**  
   
A college counselor from another school district posted a link to a Google sheet that she created, listing information for hundreds of colleges nationwide about virtual tours, info sessions, etc by college.  With her generosity, we have included the link below. It may be of use in directing seniors to find information on some of the colleges they are considering and juniors to find out virtual college visit strategies. If you have Google suite you can access the worksheet through Google docs. Please always check each college’s website for the most up-to-date information.
