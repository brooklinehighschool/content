The African American and Latino Scholars Program (AALSP) is an enrichment program for self-identifying students of color at Brookline High School. Over four years students participate in Scholars Seminar with a curriculum that explores themes relevant to the experiences of black and brown people in the world, the United States, and in Boston. Additionally, the AALSP Seminars are designed to help Scholars reach the three central objectives of the program: higher student grade point averages, increased pupil enrollment in honors/Advanced Placement classes, and acceptance into the National Honors Society. Scholars take field trips, host speakers, receive college counseling, and participate in community gatherings. Scholars apply for extracurricular programs that broaden their experience and prepare them for life after high school. Scholars are required to take college preparatory classes and maintain their GPA in order to remain eligible.  
​  
The program follows the student as they go from freshman to senior year. Freshmen, sophomores, and juniors all attend seminar 4 times a week (as a regular class does), while seniors attend twice a week. Over the course of four years, the program teaches students important minority history, seeks to instill cultural pride, provides academic support (thanks to connections with the Calculus Project), and provides guidance with the college process. The curriculum is as follows:  
  
  
**Freshman Year:**   
  
​Freshmen members of the AALSP community will learn what it means to be a Scholar, and learn of the rich legacy of achievement and valor of their community.  They will connect with the larger school community and each other.  The primary focus of the freshmen curriculum is to introduce our Scholars to black and brown activists and contributors throughout US History.  By developing a better understanding of these important figures, they will see themselves as inheritors of the movement, and will acquire mentors and role models.  Additionally, students will receive weekly math and science support.  
  
**Sophomore Year:**  
  
Sophomore Scholars will continue to see themselves as inheritors of rich academic and familial culture and traditions.  The primary focus of the sophomore curriculum is to examine current events through the lens of institutional power and discrimination.  We further investigate how these events and happenings have impacted, and continue to impact, communities of color.  Additionally, Sophomore Scholars will create and edit their resume and apply for summer enrichment programs.  Weekly math and science support is provided. Sophomores will be strongly encouraged to take the PSAT and P-ACT to introduce themselves to standardized testing.  
  
**Junior Year:**  
  
Junior Scholars continue to examine the current events that impact communities of color, such as immigration and gentrification, but also consider the historical context and legacy of each topic.  Additionally, Junior Scholars begin thinking more concretely about life post-high school.  Students apply to enrichment programs and visit colleges and universities.  Weekly math and science support is provided. Students are again encouraged to take the PSAT, and to take the SAT/ACT as well.  
  
**Senior Year:**  
  
Senior Scholars will receive help with the college and scholarship application process. The students will be required to finalize their college lists, and will receive help when doing so. Students are pushed to remain on top of deadlines, and to seek help when needed with college essay editing, etc. Furthermore, students will be encouraged to apply for scholarships. A film study of important documentaries surrounding history and issues for underrepresented minorities will ensue post-college application season. Multiple documentaries are viewed, criticized, and discussed. Students graduate from the Scholars program in June.
