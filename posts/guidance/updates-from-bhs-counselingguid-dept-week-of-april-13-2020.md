​**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS- CARETAKERS**  
  
The goal of the BHS Counseling/Guidance department and the school community overall is to encourage students to try their best in school while keeping their stress levels to a healthy level. This time with COVID19 challenges all of our stress levels, our patience, and our strength. There are important messages in this week’s update but the MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE TODAY IS **TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF! REACH OUT IF YOU NEED SUPPORT! BHS COUNSELORS AND OTHER STAFF ARE HERE FOR YOU… AT A DISTANCE BUT WITH AS MUCH CARE AS EVER! PLEASE DO NOT WORRY ALONE.**  
Some BHS students are working to put together an easily accessible resource list for our social/ emotional well-being and basic needs. That resource will come soon. In the meantime, please check out the resources listed below and do not hesitate to contact your counselor, dean, or caring BHS adult. We are here to help and support every BHS student!

**The [Western Mass Recovery Learning Community (RLC)](http://www.westernmassrlc.org/hidden-community-happenings-fix/888-on-line-and-phone-supports-march-2020) creates conditions that support healing and growth for individuals and the community as a whole through learning opportunities, advocacy, peer-to-peer support and the development of regional and national networks.**  
   
We know how important it is to engage in healthy and preventative practices to support our emotional well being during this quarantine. One of our BHS social workers suggests: **If you do reach out for your own outpatient therapy, many insurances are doing away with co-pays for this period of telehealth and phone appointments.**   
Depending on your insurance, there may be no co-pays **from quarantine dates of service (and possibly telehealth appointments after that)**. Take a moment to call your insurance company to check!  
   
Eyal Arkin, David Carmel, Anat Katz, Noah Schwartz, Benja Rosenzweig, Liam Smolyar - BHS students - working in combination with several other BHS students, has created a **web-based service to take, purchase, and deliver grocery orders for people who are not able to get to the grocery store themselves (primarily the elderly and the immunocompromised)**.  The website ([https://projectdriveway.org/home](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/4MZUCyPJX5uy5zAOHZe4Y9?domain%3Dprojectdriveway.org&sa=D&ust=1587169040811000&usg=AOvVaw07lS0w6p6n2UIDLy6q5fTQ)) lists the current team and a link for others to join them, provides a way to order, explains how the team is complying with sanitary measures and cleanliness, and provides a page of other resources.  If you know of anyone who might be in need of this service please consider sending this to them or publicizing this in some way.

Help your Brookline neighbor!

**SENIORS**  
**Koplik** - The MA Dept of Education (DESE) is reworking both expectations and deadlines for the Koplik Scholarship process. The following tentative changes are in process at DESE in regard to the Koplik Certificate of Mastery With Distinction Tuition Credit:  
 \*\* An extension of the submission deadline to October 1, 2020 to allow students enough time to take SAT subject tests and AP exams  
\*\* An extension of the usage deadline to Fall 2021 to allow students the opportunity to use the tuition credit  
\*\* Allowance of the tuition credit to be retroactive to the start of the fall 2020 semester for students that may receive certificates after the start of school  
   
**Getting into college is the first step. Navigating all the MAJOR changes ahead is the next.** This Thursday 4/16 at 8pm, EST join _New York Times_ bestselling author Harlan Cohen, as he helps students and parents prepare and plan for all the BIG changes ahead. Harlan came to the Brookline High School campus last year and personally delivered his engaging message to seniors about ways to get ready for college life. During this year’s interactive event, Harlan will share the latest in college news and offer a step-by-step approach to help soon-to-be high school grads succeed in college. LIVE Q & A included as part of this interactive free event.  Register here: [https://harlancohen.com/webinar041620](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/HVpQC31KwvCRl51Dsg1OtF?domain=harlancohen.com)    
   
**EXTENDED** **- Deadline for BHS Scholarship applications is this IMPORTANT REMINDER - Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2020 BHS Scholarship Application.** The deadline for applying for BHS scholarships for students attending ANY college is Friday, April 24. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code  #0424  
   
**SENIORS AND JUNIORS**  
A college counselor from another school district posted a link to a Google sheet that she created, listing information for hundreds of colleges nationwide about virtual tours, info sessions, etc by college.  With her generosity, we have included the link below. It may be of use in directing seniors to find information on some of the colleges they are considering and juniors to find out virtual college visit strategies. If you have Google suite you can access the worksheet through Google docs. Please always check each college’s website for the most up-to-date information.  
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sO7pVos0EvK0BvXoMbnyg00K6r7hXbOQE0HNXF4N4eM/htmlview](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/mQR4C4xYLwu78YzEiOjYjD?domain%3Ddocs.google.com&sa=D&ust=1586311714624000&usg=AOvVaw1RwEnCXCOvQCykRcd61T8k)  
   
**JUNIORS**  
Read this excellent quick article from an admissions representative at GA Tech. Admissions folks are genuinely understanding of the dilemma that high school juniors are worried about regarding college. This article may hopefully reassure you - [http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2020/04/02/being-seen-this-one-is-for-the-juniors/](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Wen9CPN5QlI5w4xkIzp1fy?domain=pwp.gatech.edu/)  
  
**JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES**  
**PreACT score update** - PreACT score reports are only available in paper format and were delivered to the BHS building which no one has access to at this time. I have contacted ACT and they will be delivering another set of score reports to my home in the next weeks. I will be doing some envelope stuffing at my home and then send out these score reports by mail to student homes.  
We will also be offering a zoom score report presentation, led by BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon, likely during the week of 4/27 – close to the time that score reports should be arriving by mail.  
Thanks for your patience as we develop a new plan with PreACT score distribution.
