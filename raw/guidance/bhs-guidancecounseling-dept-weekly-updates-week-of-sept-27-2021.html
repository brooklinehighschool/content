If you prefer calling, <strong>you can also call our hotline at</strong><strong> (617) 651-1468 during drop times </strong>to ask our volunteers to sign you up. If you or a friend in Brookline want a money drop but need translation help, the sign-up form will be translated, and we will also have translators available to help on the phone at specific times (listed in the FAQs above). Please let us know if you have questions, by replying to mutualaidbrookline@gmail.com or calling our hotline at (617) 651-1468.

Once the Brookline Public Library and BHA community rooms closed, residents relying on shared technology assets were left with no online resources. The new Tech Buddies program provides a tablet and 12 months of free internet access to low-income elders or adults with a disability living alone. We will also provide technology education as well as tech support for our participants. <strong>We are in desperate need of volunteers to help us make</strong><strong> the Tech Buddies program a success and we are actively recruiting volunteers for the following roles: tablet delivery/set-up/basic education (in-person) or become part of our Tech Squad (remote). </strong>Please email Sophie Gordon at sgordon@brooklinema.gov with your interest or questions. CORI background check required.<br>Student Directors of the <strong>Brookline Tutor Mentor Program (BTMP) </strong>are looking for tutors. The BTMP was founded in 2014 with the goal of connecting high-schoolers and middle schoolers both through academics and a supportive mentor system. We individually pair middle school students and high-achieving high school tutors based on students’ academic needs and interests. We aim to offer a tutor and a role model for kids who are struggling academically, need an extra challenge, or just want a<br>friend. The Brookline Tutor Mentor Program is looking to recruit high schoolers to tutor and guide middle school kids. Being a tutor-mentor is one of the most fulfilling positions in the community. Not only will you receive community service hours and a good addition to your resume, but as a high school student, tutoring gives you an opportunity to truly engage with and support a middle school student. Whether they are struggling with school or need advice from a friendly face, the tutor-mentor program is their rock that can be relied on at any time. As role models, our job is to motivate young students and aid them in growing into mature young adults. Students and their mentors often create deep bonds that transcend age differences and continue even beyond the Tutor-Mentor Program.<br>Please note: This year, the BTMP schedule is completely remote for the time being due to COVID-19. Because of this, tutoring hours are flexible! Tutors will be offered a large selection of times to meet with their students. If you apply, please regularly check your email for updates on meeting times, etc. If you are interested in giving back, earning community service hours, and adding something meaningful and unique to your resume, apply at <u>https://bit.ly/BTMPTutorApplication.</u> Please email btm@brooklineteencenter.org if you have any questions!<br><strong><u>SENIORS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>BHS Guidance department presented the Post High School Planning session for</strong><strong> seniors in the auditorium last Monday 9/20. </strong>This was a mandatory assembly for all seniors.
