		3/21/2021
	

It’s a sunny warm Sunday! I hope all of you are enjoying this spring day with more to come this week.  
  
​Students in Grades 9-11 will continue to add their course requests for 2021-22 into their student portals through 3/30.  See attached portal instructions given to students in hubs/advisories last week. As courses are considered, school and life BALANCE for each student is key. Students should have heard from their teachers regarding course level recommendations. They also should be aware of what credits they need to earn a BHS diploma by their graduation. The 2021-22 BHS Course Catalog is now available on the [BHS homepage](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/).   
   
There will be 2 IPRs (progress reports) for this Quarter 3. The first IPR was posted to student and parent portals on Monday 3/8**. The next Quarter 3 IPR will be uploaded to the student and parent portals this Thurs 3/25. The end of Quarter 3 is Tues 4/6.  
  
**This week is a regular week of school. No special schedule! Next week is a special schedule week with Monday 3/29 being a student ½ day for BHS staff professional development. Friday 4/2 is a holiday off for Good Friday/Easter.  

  
   
**Dates to Note-**  
March 9-30 - Portal open to add electives, wellness for senior year

April 6 - Quarter 3 ends  
**Mental health Supports:**  
MENTAL HEALTH IN THE TIME OF COVID  
**This Wednesday March 24 at 7:30pm: Mental Health in the Time of COVID**.  
For most of us, this past year has been the most challenging in memory. While a lot of attention has been paid to the impact of the pandemic on children, adults are suffering as well, feeling overwhelmed, depressed, distracted, afraid, angry. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in mental health issues and substance use. **On** **March 24 at 7 p.m.**, **the Brookline Department of Public Health and the Brookline Center for Community Mental Health are coming together to present a zoom forum to discuss strategies and resources for adults in our community.** Moderated by WBUR CommonHealth host Carey Goldberg, speakers will give an overview of needs and resources, followed by a Q&A. Please join us – let’s do this together!

STUDENTS' SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS FOR HELPING WITH COLLEGE/POST-HIGH SCHOOL PLANNING  
By the second semester of junior year, family stress ramps up significantly as students try to balance schoolwork, study for SATS, look into colleges or other post-BHS options, etc. All of this comes with a lot of internal and external judgment, even during years when COVID is not an issue. How can families be supportive without adding to the pressure? This year’s BHS Peer Leaders have put together some excellent tips to consider in the **Parent Tip Sheet** Student Suggestions to Parents for Helping with College/Post-High School Planning - [https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655](https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655)
