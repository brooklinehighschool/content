		9/20/2020
	

​Phew! What a week of student orientation last week. Teachers and students were working furiously to manage the “next normal” of mostly remote classes for BHS students. Counselors were working feverishly with curriculum coordinators to correct as many student scheduling errors as they could… and will continue to do this work for errors only.  
   
The two week freeze now starts tomorrow (Monday 9/21) for students to remain in their current schedule UNLESS A COURSE IS MISSING OR WAS NOT REQUESTED (IN MARCH 2020) from Monday 9/21 to Wednesday 9/30. If a student still desires a “change of mind” schedule change by 9/30, the student should be talking with their parent-guardian and current teacher about a possible change, then contacting their assigned counselor to see if a change is possible when working with curriculum coordinators and deans.  
   
If a student has questions/concerns/or just wants to say hello to their counselor, please see if the counselor has posted their weekly office hours on CANVAS or email the counselor. Please note that counselors are still working through needed schedule corrections and may be slow to respond for the next few days. But we’re still here and ready to support EVERY BHS student!  “See” you in ZOOM!

**ALL STUDENTS**
