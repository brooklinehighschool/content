Thank you Episcopal High School, TX website for this introduction regarding Summer Plans Suggestions for high school students:  
   
“We encourage students to use their summers wisely. This can mean doing anything from an academic program to community service to a good old-fashioned job. Below we have listed a number of summer opportunities \[and websites with summer resources\] of varying content, location, length of time, and cost. Some programs are free, while others cost thousands of dollars; most fall somewhere in between. Please know that the cost of a program is not a measure of its quality or prestige in the eyes of college admission offices. This list is just a starting point to get you thinking. There are many more programs out there, so feel free to explore!”   
   
**BHS Guidance has added to the list below. By listing the programs below, we do not endorse but simply mention as ideas to get students thinking about interesting summer options. We strongly recommend students consider local employment options (see Kate Cordner, the BHS Career Counselor in Room 280/279, or stop by the College-Career Center Jobs board outside 279). Also local community service can be a great way to give back to your community while gaining valuable experience in the greater Brookline area.** ​

**Enjoying and relaxing during the summer is also important for balance in busy high school students’ lives!**
