_This blog post is brought to you by your sophomore representatives: Laura, Fabian, Tina and Kalina  
  
_The first meetings of Legislature and Student Council were extremely productive. This was the first time we met together as a group this school year, and we immediately got to work. Three sophomore representatives, Tina Li, Fabian Ugalde, and Kalina Brookfield, spearheaded a very efficacious poster effort- you’ll see them around school, they look great! We also brainstormed video ideas to promote Student Government around the school, and with that, we went off to class at 9:40, feeling invigorated by work well done. We’re really excited to welcome our freshmen representatives and new Student Council members, so make sure to run or apply for both bodies if you’re interested!
