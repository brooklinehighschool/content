On Sunday we went to the center of Mexico City to the Templo Mayor, where there was a preserved Aztec pyramid. We explored the many layers of the ruins and the museum nearby.

 During the walk through the ruins we read about Aztec history and stories, especially about different gods and myths. There are a notable amount of sacrifices involved in Aztec history. Pictured on the left is a wall of plaster skulls near the museum entrance. We also saw various artifacts such as ceramic vessels, weapons, jewelry, and paintings, and learned about Aztec culture and trade.  
  
Next we traveled to Teotihuacan, the site of ancient pyramids built by the Aztecs. The two major ones were the Moon and Sun Pyramids. (The one in the picture is the Sun Pyramid, which is the tallest). Though it looked a little daunting it only took about 10 minutes to climb up! There was a really beautiful view at the top.   
  
After we left Teotihuacan we ate at a restaurant nearby and learned about the many uses of the maguey plant, which can serve as natural paper, thread, or lotion. It also is used to produce pulque and agave.   
  
​After the excursion we returned to Cuernavaca and ate dinner with our host families.​ - Alice
