Senior Year  

--------------

Twelfth grade (senior) seminars are conducted throughout the day and may be taught by any of the senior team guidance counselors.  The process of the college application is reviewed with careful instructions given with respect to coordinating applications on common application and Naviance.  The process by which teachers write and submit recommendations is covered as are the forms necessary for counselor and teacher recommendations.  While senior seminars are presented in a classroom setting, students will need to set up frequent individual meetings with their own counselors to continue the game plan laid out in junior year.  there are often modifications to be made, but by and large, the plans laid out junior year should be adhered to as much as possible.
