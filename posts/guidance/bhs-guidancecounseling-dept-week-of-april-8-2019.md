See your counselor for more feedback or questions!  
 Some suggested summer pre-college opportunities with financial aid available - [http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/](http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/)  Please note that attending a pre-college program at any particular college does not usually offer any special consideration during future admissions at that school.  
   
**SENIORS**  
  
**This week…..Wed April 10, 7pm, MA Educational Financing Authority’s (MEFA) “Paying the Bill” presentation –BHS Auditorium** - Parents and seniors are invited to attend a free seminar on understanding financial aid award letters and making a plan to pay the college bill.

Before the seminar, be sure to visit MEFA’s website — [mefa.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmefa.org&sa=D&ust=1553194361106000&usg=AFQjCNGYqF5L9guIIf19g7eGsqBnriBAEg) — to download a copy of the seminar presentation in English or Spanish and explore other tools and resources to assist you in the college planning process. And make sure to bring your financial aid award letters to the seminar to get all of your questions answered after the presentation.
