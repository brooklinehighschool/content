                      <li>Another special school schedule is happening this week of Nov 2. Students will not have school on Tues 11/3 due to a BHS Professional Development Day. The revised schedule is attached to this email.</li>
                      <li>Hybrid schooling has started for 9th graders at OLS this past week.&nbsp;It was fun to welcome many 9th graders into the OLS building and the classrooms and hallways!</li>
                      <li>Hybrid schooling for students in Grades 10-12 are targeted to start on November 9.</li>
                      <li>BHS STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE REMOTE WEDNESDAYS&nbsp;as of last week.</li>
                      <li>Quarter 1 IPR (interim progress report) #2 will be uploaded to both student and parent portals this Wednesday 10/28 ONLY FOR STUDENTS WHOSE GRADE IS BELOW A C+ or whose grade went down by one full grade since IPR #1.&nbsp;These IPRs offer an excellent opportunity for parents/caregivers to discuss the successes that a student is experiencing with school and provide a morale boost for classes that may not be going smoothly. Students can still improve academic work between now and the Quarter 1 end date of 11/6.</li>
                      <li>Quarter 1 ends on November 6</li>

                  <div class="paragraph">Counselors continue to work very closely with seniors right now for advising and counselor recommendation writing. <strong>If any student issue is urgent, please indicate URGENT in the email heading. Counselors will be responding to all emails within 2-3 school days, but they will prioritize emails marked urgent. </strong>Thanks for your understanding!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<strong><u>ALL STUDENTS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Haven’t gotten your cohort assignment yet in Gr 10-12? Not all students have gotten their cohort assignment yet so please be patient as that planning continues through this week. Thank you!<br>&nbsp;<br>L Grade, Curriculum Level Changes and Class Drop Timelines:<br>For class drops (with end of term is Nov 6), then:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * For changing of classes, 12/1 will be the deadline&nbsp;for curriculum level changes for full year classes. After that date, a special action form is needed and W on transcript.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* For non full year courses, the deadline for a semester course will be extended to 11/3 (one week after the 2nd IPR of quarter 1). After that date, the course will be on the transcript with a W.<br>&nbsp;<br>L grade&nbsp; (Late entry) -&nbsp;If a level change occurs within 10 class periods of the end of the marking period, the student will earn a grade of "L” in the new course for that marking period, as of 10/19.<ul>
                      <li><strong>“L” Grade</strong> – The “L” grade occurs if a student makes a course level change within the last ten class periods at the end of a marking period, they will receive an L on their transcript for that term grade in the NEW course.&nbsp; The “L” stands for late entry. <strong>This policy is particularly important for SENIORS to be aware of since the L grade may appear on transcripts sent to colleges for Term 1.</strong></li>
