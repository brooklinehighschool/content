                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Be sure you can log into your Naviance account before the summer. </strong>If you forgot your login info, email your counselor or Lenny Libenzon (BHS College Counselor).</li>
                      <li><strong>Complete the attached Jr Questionnaire and drop off or forward to your counselor. </strong>This information is <strong>required </strong>for your counselor to write your college recommendation. You can also complete this questionnaire on your Naviance account under surveys. Email your counselor when you’ve completed the questionnaire.</li>
                      <li><strong>Have one (or both) parents-caregivers complete the attached Parent Brag Sheet and return to your counselor before summer vacation starts.</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Keep researching and building your college list. </strong>Remember you should be building a list of approx. 8-10 colleges to apply to with 3 being “reach” schools, 4 being “target/ 50-50” schools and 3-4 being “likely” schools that you would be very happy to attend!</li>
                      <li><strong>Keep signing up for virtual college info sessions and visits. </strong>Many colleges are now opening up for in-person info sessions and tours so go to the college’s website and sign up! If you plan to drive through a college’s campus, be sure to stop by the admissions office or email the office to let them know you were on the campus, even the colleges in the greater Boston area.</li>
                      <li><strong>Start brainstorming a rough draft of your college essay. </strong>Class of 2022 Common Application essay prompts attached to this email.</li>
                      <li><strong>Start completing the Common Application after the first week of August. </strong>This effort will be well worth it so you don’t have to stress about completing after your senior year courses start! You can also see if any colleges you are applying to require essay supplements and start brainstorming those as well.</li>
                      <li><strong>Be sure you have registered for any college admissions testing (SATs or ACTs) you may need to apply to schools of interest. </strong>Keep in mind that MOST colleges are still <strong>test optional</strong> for the Class of 2022. You may not NEED test scores to apply.</li>

The application has now opened!<br>&nbsp;<br>The Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) is an AmeriCorps program dedicated to increasing youth academic enrichment and college and career exploration through Out-of-School-Time (OST) interventions and data-driven programming. We are a passionate team that strives every day to empower young people to succeed as part of a national movement to achieve education equity. We do this because we believe that all young people have a right to Caring Adults, Safe Spaces, A Healthy Start, An Effective Education, and An Opportunity to Serve.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a Mass Promise Fellow, participants serve at one of our partner youth-serving programs at schools, city agencies, or community-based organizations in Massachusetts. Their mission will be to build intentional relationships with young people between 6th and 12th grade and support their academic engagement or post-secondary success. Fellows will work to decrease the dropout rate, close the opportunity gap, and support the futures of youth. If someone believes in the power of relationship building to positively impact the life of a young person, this role is for them.<br>&nbsp;<br>MPF's training curriculum, networking opportunities,&nbsp;and career coaching provide our Fellows with the opportunity to increase their leadership development and gain meaningful skills needed for careers in the education and non-profit sectors.&nbsp;On average, 25% of Fellows are hired by their host site for full-time employment following their year of service. Within three months of graduating from MPF, 95% of our Fellows have full time employment or are continuing school.<br>&nbsp;<br>Students can learn more about MPF, the benefits of our program, and our host sites across Massachusetts at&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/yT4pCo26yKu6zD55hzV_JR?domain=nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com">https://masspromisefellows.org/apply</a><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Another brief article on considerations for college search and applications – 8 Factors to never consider when choosing a college</strong> - https://www.collegedata.com/resources/getting-in/8-factors-to-never-consider-when-choosing-a-college?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=8_factors_to_never_consider&amp;dm_i=50NV,E8CM,2HLH1D,1HMPF,1<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Start becoming familiar with financial aid information – Check out MEFA (MA Educational Financing Authority) - FREE state funded college financial aid information resource </strong>- <a href="https://www.mefa.org/financial-aid-made-simple">https://www.mefa.org/financial-aid-made-simple</a><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Brimmer &amp; May School is happy to announce their first&nbsp;<strong>College Essay Writing Bootcamp</strong>&nbsp;this summer!
