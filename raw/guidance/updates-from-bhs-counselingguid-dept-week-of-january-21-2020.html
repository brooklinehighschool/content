DEADLINE APRIL 15, 2020 - </strong>Civil discourse is a concept that goes beyond a simple dictionary definition, and understanding it involves a combination of personal experience and ‘big ideas.’ Perhaps it is something you recognize from an occurrence in your own life. Maybe you can easily recognize when it is missing. Differing perspectives are a key part of learning, of democracies, and of civil society. For this essay, we ask you not only share your comprehension of what civil discourse is meant to be but to also relate what it looks like when it works – and when it doesn’t – and why. Perhaps you will choose to include mention of a time when you, yourself, were part of an exchange intended to understand something – how did you go about it? We encourage you to bring emotion, creativity, specific examples (including current events), and well-researched facts into what you write. A good essay will demonstrate how civil discourse is not just an abstract idea, but is, in fact, action inspired by constitutional principles, and demonstrated through civic virtues. We want to know what you think civil discourse truly means.<br>The winners of this year’s contest will receive:<br>1st Place – $7,500 and a scholarship to our 2020 Constitutional Academy in Washington, D.C.Runners Up – 5 prizes at $1,500 eachHonorable Mentions – 8 prizes at $500 each<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579225303304000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GrnQJjZUt5CPBwHWSURZR">https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/</a><br><br><strong>UPDATED BHS Clubs/Organizations Info for students:</strong><br><strong><u>Interested in Medicine?

Please use the same application as above.&nbsp; The Scholarship Committee would like parents to know that we use three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly,&nbsp;<strong>unmet financial need</strong>.&nbsp; There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com.</u>&nbsp;Please use code &nbsp;#0424<br><strong>Find the January 2020 Scholarship Letter attached here.</strong><br><strong>Deferred to regular decision?</strong> Please carefully read advice from the BHS Counseling/Guidance Department about next steps – attached<br>&nbsp;<br>Seniors – If you haven’t already, <strong>please say thanks to your teachers and counselor who supported you by writing recommendations</strong> for your application process. Just stopping by to say thanks and let them know where you stand with admissions or writing a quick note makes a BIG difference to those who helped you!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Early Decision acceptances - please contact all colleges also applied to for EA/RD and remove your name from their lists...and congrats!</strong><br><br>As College Counselor Tara Anne Dowling suggests-<br>“Say 'Thank you' as well as 'No, thank you'&nbsp;<br>--‘Thank you for taking time with my credentials’, ‘thank you for answering my questions’, ‘thank you for offering me a scholarship’ etc.<br>--‘No, thank you, I will be attending another college’ (you can say the name of your attending college if you feel comfortable)<br>This is done in myriad ways:<br>* via the online portal they may give you the option to decline your offer and say where you are going<br>* via email to the rep who has been working with you<br>* via post--did you get a big packet in the mail? There may be a postcard that asks for you to respond with info if you are declining the offer<br>What is goodwill and why does it matter?<br>--Admission officers very often become invested in the students they are reviewing. They have read your file, recommended you to the admission committee, and perhaps put you up for a scholarship. Hard work deserves a big thank you.<br>--You never know if you may need to transfer<br>--You may have a younger sibling or friend who will attend this university. How can a good relationship that helps other people be a bad thing?<br>What's in it for me?<br>--If good will doesn't move you (or good manners!) then think of kids on waitlists who are dying to find out if they can have that place that is currently being held by you. You can help colleges clean up their records and make room for other candidates!"<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Transcript release / Teacher-Counselor Recommendation Deadlines </strong><br><strong>Upcoming due dates:</strong><br><strong>Note that you have missed the deadline if applying for the 1st time with Feb 1 or 15th application deadlines.
