-----------------

A BH_​​_**S​ustainability** initiative to cultivate learning and leadership for a sustainable future

* * *

We are all accountable for our students' future
-----------------------------------------------

Preparing students for the future includes the future of climate change.  It is _not_ up to the next generation; It's up to all of us to build and model a culture of sustainability in our schools.  That includes school staff, our parent and stakeholder community, our coaches and advisors, and our PSB leadership.  We must all create the culture we want — and need.  Each group of stakeholders has a role to play:

**Students**

* * *

Organize and demand change from our school by meeting with Administrative leaders, demanding curricular changes, proposing school-based legislation (student council and legislature) and amplifying ideas in the school newspaper.

**Staff**

* * *

Model sustainable practices and set norms for minimizing use of supplies, recycling, composting and commuting.  Embed sustainability across the curriculum.  Support student sustainability initiatives and activism.

**Community**

* * *

Parents and caretakers demand that schools prepare students to sustain themselves in a climate crisis.  Join school Green Teams to advocate for sustainable cafeteria menus, school gardens, curriculum and making sustainability a core school mission.

* * *

Building a school-wide sustainability culture
---------------------------------------------

Let's embed sustainability into our school mission and practices, including:

Making climate justice part of our racial justice work
