​The co-directors of the Harvard College Alberta V. Scott Leadership Academy (AVS), a mentorship program for Black high school girls, are looking for more mentees for the spring semester. The mentors of this program are all Black women at Harvard, and they pair mentors and mentees based on common academic and extracurricular interests.  
Last semester, they hosted Zoom meetings about a variety of engaging and useful topics, such as college preparation, self-care as Black women, and resume-writing. They were also able to invite engaging speakers like Lisa Price, the founder of the haircare brand Carol's Daughter, and Camille Acker, the author of a book they read as a group throughout the fall. This spring, they plan to provide more useful virtual programming, including a STEM career panel.   
Logistically, AVS meets on Saturdays from 12-1:30p ET on Zoom. Their first meeting will be on Saturday, February 6th.

[SWS Admissions Info Packet](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/NvJgCER6xvcnLn49cNHsz4?domain=docs.google.com)  
Please take the opportunity to see if SWS could be a good fit.  
   
School Within a School, located on the fourth floor of BHS, is an alternative, democratic community for a diverse group of approximately 120 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Goals for students include taking as much responsibility for their education as possible, sharing decision-making in running SWS, and contributing to building a caring community. For 50 years, SWS has provided students with the opportunity to participate actively as leaders in their own educations and develop meaningful relationships with teachers based on mutual respect. Admission to SWS is based on a lottery, the criteria of which are determined by the SWS Town Meeting. In addition to Town Meeting, SWS students take at least two classes in the program, including English. They take the rest of their classes in the mainstream of BHS. More information about the program, and the admissions process, can be found at [swsbrookline.org](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/1cMBCG6Q8xuqkq3YI7B7GC?domain=swsbrookline.org).

Join Sunrise Brookline!  We are the Brookline Hub of the [Nationwide Sunrise Movement](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/cCp6CBBR6psAOOZwczCdzN?domain=sunrisemovement.org), a movement to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process.   We're building an army of young people to make climate change an urgent priority across America, end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics, and elect leaders who stand up for the health and wellbeing of all people.  As a relatively new hub, we have organized actions around political change in Brookline, including marches and lobbying groups. We are currently working on multiple projects to elect Brookline leaders that represent our values, educate our community members about environmental racism, build our hub, organize actions around climate justice, and mobilize young people to demand change.  
We are hosting a welcome call on Sunday, February 7th at 1PM and Wednesday, February 10th at 8pm to learn more about Sunrise Brookline and find out how you can get involved.

Mental health Supports:  
   
Coping groups bring together people who are going or who have gone through similar life experiences. In [MassSupport](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/rpIsCW6jqvuxKZ1xI6SALx?domain=r20.rs6.net)'s new free and confidential COVID-19 coping groups, we'll be talking about how to handle feelings of isolation and stress in a supportive space to enhance coping skills and foster a sense of connection.  
Groups will last about 90 minutes and participants do the vast majority of the talking. A brief educational component is included. While our trained, caring counselors and clinicians facilitate, these groups are not therapy.  
  
Our coping groups are completely free, and you can sign up for multiple groups. Register below:

The call center will be open from Monday-Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. until further notice. The number for the call center is 617-879-5636.

Residents are encouraged to utilize the call center, and direct all COVID-19 and vaccine related questions there in order to ensure the town's Department of Public Health may continue to focus on its core work of conducting contact tracing and stopping the spread of the coronavirus.  
The Town of Brookline's COVID-19 portal remains the best place for Brookline specific information about the pandemic, as well as updates about town-specific vaccination news.

Brookline Cares - Empowerment Coats winter drive  
Brookline Cares is a student-run, volunteer organization started by Brookline High School students. Our organization promotes awareness, fundraises, and accepts donations of winter clothing to donate to people in need. The clothing collected is given to people in communities with high rates of COVID-19 in the Greater Boston area. We are urgently raising money through a GoFundMe to purchase Empowerment coats to give out to people in communities with high rates of COVID. These communities also have high rates of poverty and homelessness. Empowerment coats are coats that convert into sleeping bags and can be used by people experiencing homelessness or people who do not have shelter.  Visit their website for more information: [https://www.empowermentplan.org/the-coat](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/LAEOCxk715uBlz17t8FsFF?domain=empowermentplan.org).

HAVE YOU APPLIED TO COLLEGE? IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO READ YOUR EMAILS (FROM COLLEGES AND BHS)!  ALSO BE SURE TO FOLLOW ANY APPLICANT PORTAL DIRECTIONS for colleges you will be applying to, if they have a portal protocol. Your efficiency in opening up these accounts after applying is sometimes monitored by admissions offices to gauge your level of interest!  
 “As you look back on your life, you realize that every time you thought you were being rejected from something good, you were actually being redirected to something better.”  
Were you deferred from a college that you are still interested in being considered? See BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon’s What to Do if you are Deferred or Waitlisted info sheet – see attached. If you need any guidance, please reach out to your counselor or BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon.  
Thinking about a post grad path that is NOT college specific? Check in with your counselor and/or Kate Kennedy, the BHS Career Counselor, for ideas and resources.    
Seniors – When submitting your transcript release forms electronically, please:

*   use the updated link shared by your counselor (on their CANVAS page or by email)
*   be sure to list your college names and addresses CORRECTLY AS THEY APPEAR OFFICIALLY ON THE COLLEGE’S WEBSITE OR NAVIANCE. The processing of your request is slowed down by not including the official name of the college or putting in wrong information.
