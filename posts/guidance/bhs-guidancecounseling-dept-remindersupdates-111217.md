**Seniors-**   
\-Senior students who have applied for any college application early/rolling deadlines MUST BE READING ANY EMAILS SENT TO THEM from these colleges

*   If senior applied early action/decision/rolling to at least one college this Fall, please note that it takes time for colleges to download, sort and verify the materials they receive from all over the world as they update their portals. Even though documents come in electronically, usually the information needs to be matched and verified by admissions staff and this takes time. It is possible that you might get an automated email from the college you have applied to stating that your transcript or letters of recommendation are missing. Most likely the materials were already sent, but have not been processed on the college side yet. If the problem persists, we recommend that you call the university to double check on the status of your application. If the situation is not resolved within a week, please check with your counselor or the Guidance Office regarding the status of your documents. Please be assured that all items from BHS will be submitted on time if you met our deadlines.

 As always, contact your counselor if you have questions or concerns about the process (email or stop by/ leave a note).  
In addition, do not hesitate to contact Mr. Libenzon, BHS College Counselor, with any questions regarding the application process.

December 1 deadline - request by November 3 (late)
