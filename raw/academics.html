                <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;">The BHS Course Catalog represents the menu of course and program offerings, which constitutes one of the most comprehensive educational programs offered at any high school. There are hundreds of courses -- in the traditional academic disciplines and in our valued elective programs. There are courses at different levels of intellectual challenge, including Advanced Placement programs in 18 subjects. In addition, there are four alternative programs -- School-Within-A-School (SWS), Alternative Choices in Education (ACE), ExCEL, and Winthrop House -- that enable Brookline High to address the needs of all of our students.<br><br>Your responsibility is to choose the most appropriate and challenging program for you. I encourage you to read the catalog carefully and discuss it with your teachers, your counselor, and your parents—all to ensure that you make the best selections you can. We have eight blocks in our schedule. With our demanding graduation requirements as reminders, I encourage you to take at least six courses. Also, please know that the course selections you make this spring determine how we staff the high school. Assigning the right number of teachers to the specific courses that students select will become even more crucial this spring as the district works to prepare the best and most fair budget for all Brookline schools. In order to maintain appropriate class sizes across all BHS programs, I will need to commit staff accurately to courses by the end of this school year. What this means for students and families is that we will need you to choose courses very carefully this spring and commit to those courses as the ones you will take for the coming school year.</div>
