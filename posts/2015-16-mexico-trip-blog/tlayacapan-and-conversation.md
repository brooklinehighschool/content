On Feb 24, the BHS Mexico group went  to Tlayacapan a small town in the state of Morelos. We went to visit a museum where there are 500 year old mummies that had been found in pyramids surrounding their town. They are very famous and well known for being some of the oldest and most intact mummies found in Mexican pyramids. The town of Tlayacapan is a very modest and peaceful place. Within its town they have many work shops of beautiful pottery which is something that the town is known for doing. During this time the students were able to go and explore the small town with large groups. Some focused on buying pottery, others went to eat and try some of their food, and groups went to get frappes and ice cream. There was sometime to relax and kick a ball and to just talk about our experiences here.   
  
During some nights at the Instituto Cuauhnáhuac, we also exchange our stories and experiences with Mexican students who are learning to speak and write in English. The bonds that strangers are able form in a short amount of time is so admirable that by the time we end the conversation we feel like we've known each other for a long time. Being able to use what we are learning in class and putting it in practice gives us inspiration to keep learning and to get better and better. - José
