Naviance
--------

Naviance is a computer program used by many high schools to assist with the college application process. It maintains data on colleges all across the country and the world and is accessible from any computer with Web access. In addition, Naviance keeps track of recent BHS college applications, student statistics, and admissions decisions. Students and parents now have access to a wide range of college admissions information. BHS uses Naviance for a number of purposes, including helping to research college options, and sending BHS materials to colleges.  Naviance also has tools to help students explore their learning style, possible careers and college majors.  
  
Each student at Brookline High School is assigned a Naviance account at he beginning of their freshman year.  Students receive this information in freshman seminars.  Students can also contact their guidance counselor for log in information or to reset their username and password.    
  
Naviance is designed for parents and students to work together during the college application process.   Parents are encouraged to work with their son/daughter, using the student’s account and password.  Additionally, parents can explore Naviance as a guest, logging in with the password “bhs” (case sensitive).  Please note that we do not provide a separate password to parents.

_College Lookup_ – It’s easy to look up information on any college of interest to you. Students can find out admissions requirements, majors and activities offered, and statistics about the student body at the click of a button. It is easy to research colleges as current college contact information is readily available, including a direct link to the college homepage.  
_Scattergrams/Application History_ – Because we use Naviance to keep track of BHS student applications and admissions decisions, families can access statistics and graphs that represent BHS applicants to specific schools. These graphs show the SAT/ACT scores and GPAs of applicants (without names) and indicate whether the student was admitted waitlisted or denied. This data allows students to have an understanding of how their statistics match up to previous applicants. You are strongly encouraged to use this feature in conjunction with consultation with your counselor and Mr. Libenzon (BHS College Counselor) to create a well-balanced college list.
