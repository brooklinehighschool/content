﻿Each year Brookline High School welcomes approximately 70 new international students from around the world.  Some students are here for a temporary stay, while others plan to live in the United States permanently.    
  
Most international students have an English Language Assessment upon registration.  We offer a highly successful  English Language Education Program to students who require these services.    
  
​Please note that we are no longer issuing I-20's for attendance at Brookline High School.
