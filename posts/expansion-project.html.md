BHS Expansion Project
---------------------

In May 2018, Brookline voters supported a debt exclusion override to fund the expansion and renovation of Brookline High School. This building project will include the construction of a new building at the 111 Cypress Street site, (k/n/a 22 Tappan Street), a new Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) building to replace the building at the corner of Tappan and Greenough Streets, renovations to the 3rd floor Old Science Labs and Deferred Maintenance of the main building, UAB and the Tappan gymnasium, as well as improvements to Cypress Playground.  
  
​Construction on the Brookline High School Expansion began on June 10, 2019.  Over the next two years, the team of Hill International, Skanska USA Building, and William Rawn Associates, will oversee the construction of a new science wing at the corner of Tappan and Greenough and a new building at 22 Tappan Street.   
  
Please know that Skanska will work with subcontractors and craftsmen to ensure sensitivity to the surrounding neighborhood, and to maintain a clean and safe job site at all times. Construction is expected to be completed by November 2021. An overview on the project progress for all three sites can be accessed below: ​
