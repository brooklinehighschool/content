Our Program
-----------

The Brookline High School Cheerleading Program offers both fall and winter seasons. In the Fall, the team cheers for Varsity Football home and away games. In the Winter season, the team cheers for select Varsity Basketball (Men and Women's) home games and a few Varsity home Wrestling matches. In both seasons, the Cheer team learns a competitive routine to compete in 4-5 local cheerleading competitions, including the Bay State League Competition. The cheerleading team welcomes both men and women to try out- and has competed as both an all-girl and a co-ed team.  
  
For the Fall Season: 

*   Tryouts are held for all incoming 9th-12th graders in June prior to the Fall Season. Preseason starts the last week of August and will involve preparing for both gameday performances and competition. All cheerleaders will be expected to attend Choreography, which may occur during preseason or a weekend early in September. Practices will be held afterschool Mondays-Thursday in Tappan Gym 2, most games are on Friday night or Saturday afternoon, and competitions are on Saturdays or Sundays starting mid-Fall. The last game will be our annual Thanksgiving Day Football Game vs. Newton North.

For the Winter Season:

*   Tryouts for Winter Cheer will be held the first week after Thanksgiving break. Practices will be held afterschool Monday-Thursday 3-4 times a week, space permitting. Basketball Games are typically Tuesday and Friday evenings, and Wrestling matches are typically Wednesday afternoons. Competitions will start on Saturdays or Sundays starting the last week of January, and will continue through regionals in the first week of March. Cheerleaders will be expected to have a few practices during the second week of Winter Vacation, and should also be available during February Vacation to practice and compete.
