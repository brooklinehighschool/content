The Brookline High School’s [United Mind Worker learning platform](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/umw.html) continues. We are here to help and support every BHS student!  
  
**IMPORTANT - The student portal will be open until end of day this Tuesday, March 31 for all Gr 9-11 BHS students to upload their elective and wellness course selections****.** **Be sure students can access their portal now since students only can be uploading these courses to their student portal!**   
   
**2020-21 Brookline High Course Catalog** [http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/bhscat\_20\_21\_final.pdf](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/bhscat_20_21_final.pdf)  
Please email your counselor if you have any questions. Keep in mind the required BHS course credits needed for graduation and talk with your parents-caretakers about the best course load balance for you.  
   
**BHS students who registered for AP tests - The AP Coordinators sent a message to all students earlier this week. More information to come from teachers, curriculum coordinators, AP coordinators by later this week.**

**“Girls with Impact” offering free online Business mini-course for girls 12-18 years old****.** This spring course would be a great addition to keep girls **learning** through their 10 week live, online academy. Young women can launch their own venture, business or community project while gaining confidence and leadership skills.  
See this link for more information - [https://www.girlswithimpact.org/application/register-for-academy-program-covid](https://www.girlswithimpact.org/application/register-for-academy-program-covid)  
   
**IMPORTANT - 3rd Quarter IPRs (Interim Progress Reports) were issued on the student and parent portals on Friday 3/13. Students should be using this time to make up any work that is allowed by their teachers before school closure, along with completing activities suggested by their teachers on the United Minds platform. Students should contact their teacher directly if they have any questions and teachers will respond as soon as possible.**  
   
**It's time to think about your summer plans!**   
Please see the attached info sheet for many ideas (updated 3/8/20). Note that programs listed here are not all inclusive and do not suggest that Brookline High specifically endorses any program. Remember to read the intro at the top of the info sheet. See your counselor for more feedback or questions!  
Some **suggested summer pre-college opportunities** with financial aid available - [http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/](http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/)  
Please note that attending a pre-college program at any particular college does not usually offer any special consideration during future admissions at that school.  
   
**SENIORS**  
**Koplik** - The MA Dept of Education (DESE) is reworking both expectations and deadlines for the Koplik Scholarship process. We should know more by later this week and that information will be shared with all seniors and their parents/guardians. I suggest holding on any Koplik specific action steps until we know more from DESE.  
**IMPORTANT REMINDER - Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2020 BHS Scholarship Application.** The deadline for applying for BHS scholarships for students attending ANY college is April 17. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code  #0424  
   
**Fallon Ambulance is excited to offer a full scholarship to up to 2 graduating students to participate in our EMT school!** EMT training is an amazing stepping stone and can lead to several healthcare career paths as well as provide a great foundation for college careers. Upon completion of the Massachusetts EMT Certification, recipients will be given the opportunity for full-time or part-time employment with Fallon or LifeLine Ambulance Service. Employment opportunities are subject to the candidates ability to successfully complete pre-hire requirements and EMT exams.  
Interested students need to submit this linked online application along with all required documents no later than April 10, 2020. All applications will be subject to review and will be released by May 1, 2020. Award certificates will be given directly to the recipient and notification will be sent out to the High School Guidance Department.

Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college? You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please email Kate Kennedy, the BHS Career for more info.  
  
  
**SENIORS, JUNIORS, and SOPHOMORE FEMALES**
