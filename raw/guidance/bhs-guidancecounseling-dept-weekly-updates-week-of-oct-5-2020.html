                  <div class="paragraph">​Welcome to October! Thank you for taking the time to read these updates. If you have any feedback to share, please contact <a href="mailto:darby_neff-verre@psbma.org">Darby Neff-Verre</a>.&nbsp;<br>In the past update email, one of the attached FAQs 'Whom To Call When at BHS” indicated that parents/caregivers would have observer access to their student’s CANVAS account. This was not accurately updated and parents do not have this access. The newly updated document is attached with this update.<br>The goal for our high school students is to help them build responsibility and independence as learners and young people in our world. Students should be learning to use these attributes to they are ready for life after high school. However, you are concerned about your student’s follow through with school work, first talk to them. Find out what is working (and not working) from their perspective. As a way to keep communication flowing between teachers, students, parents/caregivers, and support staff, BHS teachers will be completing the first of two IPRs (Interim Progress Reports) for every student during this 1st quarter of the school year. This IPR #1 will be shared on the Parent and Student Portal by tentatively this Friday 10/9/20. More information on this IPR initiative will be forthcoming from the BHS Head of School, Anthony Meyer, and the Assistant Head of School, Hal Mason, soon.<br>Lastly, a reminder that student schedules overall should be getting finalized by this week for any unresolved issues.<br>Counselors are here and ready to support EVERY BHS student. Students should not hesitate to contact their counselor for any questions or concerns – school related, post high school planning related, extracurricular activities related, or life related!</div>
