**Dance Classes**  
﻿**The past two weeks have been such an adventure for us all. Some of my favorite activities we participated in were the dance classes we had three times this trip. The first two classes we took we learned the _Bachata_, a Latin dance originating from the Dominican Republic. The last class we took we learned the _Salsa_, which was my personal favorite. When we arrived at class the first time, everyone was nervous and awkward, thinking “do we really have to dance right now?!” But when the teacher, Gary, showed us the moves and the music came on, we all loosened up and started to have some real fun. The 8-count of the music guided us across the room, with Gary’s voice yelling out the steps, telling us to switch partners every few minutes. Everybody danced with each other, and some of the pairings were quite humorous to see. I got the chance to dance with Gary, as well as all of my friends on the trip. It didn’t matter if you “couldn’t” dance; everyone still had a great time.  
  
  At the fiesta we had at the school last night, we got to put our new moves to the test. We danced with our friends on the trip as well as our friends we had made here in Cuernavaca. At one point, Gary grabbed me and started to dance the Bachata with me. He was doing steps I had never seen, so there was a lot of stepping on feet and “sorry’s” coming from my mouth, but he was a great partner and the rush of the new, exciting dance kept me smiling and twirling around with him for a while. After the party, Gary told me I had a real knack for Latin dancing, and that I should keep practicing and improving. Hopefully, when I go home, I can take more Latin dance classes and have a part of this trip to Mexico with me at home in Brookline. - Sophia**    ﻿

**A Favorite Teacher,** **César**  
**All the teachers here in Cuauhnáuac are really amazing and they are all very helpful in terms of us wanting to enhance our Spanish speaking knowledge. One teacher specifically is César. César is a grammar and a conversation teacher and also a really nice friend. On the first day, I was really worried about the classes because I figured it would be really hard to get to know the teacher and learn Spanish for the two weeks I was here. As time passed, I got to know César a lot more and we became close to the point where everyday I looked forward to taking his class. In terms of classes he’s a very organized teacher and makes sure that each and every student understands his lesson. He’s always looking out for us and making sure we all have a good time here in Cuernavaca. He makes us feel like we’re home. Thanks César, we all love you!
