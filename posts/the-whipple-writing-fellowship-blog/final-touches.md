This blog post was written by Jacob Zucker '21 on August 16, 2020It’s crazy to think that we’re nearly done with a summer of the fellowship. So much has happened since we got started all the way back in May, and I think that I can speak for all eight of us when I say that I’m just so thankful for the opportunity that we’ve all been given through the Whipple Fellowship.   
At our last weekly meeting, all the way back on July 29, we met to discuss our work and any and all issues that we’d been facing in the writing process. We also had our third and final author visit with Danielle Legros Georges, the former poet laureate of the city of Boston. Legros Georges wrote the poetry collection The Dear Remote Nearness of You, which we all read prior to the Zoom. The powerful book draws from her experiences as an immigrant from Haiti and much more. She was so down-to-earth and had great advice for all of us.  
By the end of that week we had the goal of turning in our updrafts, which Emelia mentioned in the previous blog post. And Ben told us to take some time off during the next week, the first week of August, in order to get some distance from our work and take some time to decompress. But right after that we dove back into our pieces, and began making final edits to content in the piece. And in the coming days we’ll pair up with peers and work on grammar and word choice before turning in our final drafts.
