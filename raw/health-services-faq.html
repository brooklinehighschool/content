        <p>Parents frequently ask for guidelines for when it is advisable to keep their children home from school. The guidelines are provided so that your child can return to optimal health and also to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.
          In general for:
        </p>
        <p>CHICKEN POX (Varicella): Vaccinated children have a low incidence of contracting "break- through" chicken pox. However if your child develops a rash with blisters, a case of chicken pox should be ruled out. Notify your primary care provider and your school nurse. For a suspected case of chicken pox, keep your child home until all the scabs are crusted over and dry.</p>
        <p>WHOOPING COUGH (Pertussis): Children ages 11-18, who have not had a Tdap booster, have waning immunity to whooping cough. If your child has a cough associated with vomiting, keep your child home and consult your primary care provider and notify your school nurse.</p>
        <p>RASH: If your child has a rash, keep your child home. Call your child's primary care provider for diagnosis and treatment if indicated and inform the school nurse.</p>

Your child may return to school if the ringworm is small and in a covered area. For exposed ringworm, your child may return to school after 24 hours of using the recommended medication.</p>

      <h3><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('FAQ2');">If your child suffers from seasonal allergies, (runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, sneezing or congestion)</a></h3>
      <p></p>
      <div id="FAQ2" style="display: none;">
        <p>please consult with your health care provider now for appropriate treatment. Many students benefit from medications and/or eye drops which can be given at home in the evening or morning. These may be prescription or over the counter medications. These are not stocked in the school clinics. If your child will need allergy medication at school, you and your doctor must fill out a medication authorization form and submit it along with the medication to your school nurse. Benadryl should not be considered a standard allergy treatment. Students who receive Benadryl will need to be taken home for rest/observation. Other measures that help are to wash hands well when coming in from outdoors after recess or play, to shower in the evening before bed and to keep windows shut at night.</p>
