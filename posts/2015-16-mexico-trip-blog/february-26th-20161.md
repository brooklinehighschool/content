One of the best parts of our stay in Cuernavaca has been the excellent teachers at Cuauhnáhuac. I had the opportunity to be in an individual grammar focused class with Estela. With her help, I think I made some breakthroughs in my Spanish learning. She challenged me with new grammar and vocabulary, she was patient when I made mistakes, and she always encouraged me with a ¨Sí, señorita, perfecto!¨ Estela improved my confidence in speaking because I had a lot of time with her to practice and et helpful feedback. Learning a language is a long and difficult process, but the teachers at Cuauhnáhuac made these two weeks of our language-learning journeys absolutely rewarding and enjoyable.
