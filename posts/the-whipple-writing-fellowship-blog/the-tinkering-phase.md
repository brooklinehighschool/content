Blog post written by Ryan Xia on June 18, 2020

Hello everyone! This is Ryan with your weekly Whipple Fellowship news report. Our main story today: I have no idea how to begin a blog post—so let’s get going! It’s June, which means we’re currently in the tinkering phase and I’m still developing my ideas. I want to write a comedic short story examining social hierarchy and inequality in our society. During our one-on-one meetings, Ben recommended that I read some short stories from other authors for inspiration. Ms. Mains also suggested the book Dig by A.S. King. Following their suggestions, I’ve basically been reading a lot the past few weeks. As I go, I’m trying to note down what I like and don’t like about the author’s writing. Ben also recommended that I should broaden my options for story concepts. I’ve begun another small list of “what if scenarios.” It’s a strange paradox, but the more I tinker, the more I feel intimidated to actually start writing. There are just so many things to consider. We’ll see how everything pans out by July.  
​  
In other news, summer is here, which comes with its pros and cons. Pros: I have more time to think about writing and to relax a little. Cons: I also have more time to stress out about writing and to feel guilty relaxing too much. Also, knowing that the summer heat is coming, my family has decided to migrate South. I’m currently in Williamsburg, Virginia soaking in the rays and the humidity. It’s a lot calmer here with Covid-19, though, which has definitely assisted in maintaining my sanity. Ben keeps talking about how writing is often an isolated activity. It’s pretty isolated here, so maybe that will help. Anyway, I hope everyone is still doing well up in Brookline and am looking forward to meeting as a full group again in July!
