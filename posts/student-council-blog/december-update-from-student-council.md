I hope everything had a great Thanksgiving and Snow Day! Some updates from Student Council:  

*   Brookline voted to lower the voting age to 16! While the town is still seeking approval from the state, people 16 and over can still register to vote through the Brookline town website. If you have a valid MA driver’s licence, you can register online. If not, you can mail in a registration form available on the website below.  
    *   [https://www.brooklinema.gov/139/Voter-Registration](https://www.brooklinema.gov/139/Voter-Registration)  
        
*   Before break, legislature discussed the picnic table headphone bill. Student Council is currently working on revisions.  
    
*   Student Council is also looking to collect information on club demographics in regards to club funding. If you would like funding for a club, a form will be sent out in the coming weeks.  
    
*   Some Student Council members are looking to clarify various athletic policies for seniors, and out-of-school sports.  
    

  
We hope that the assemblies held for all grades were informative! We loved hearing your feedback on what we’re working on, and we’ll be in touch soon about what we’re working on.  
  
Thanks!  
Jack Heuberger, and Student Council
