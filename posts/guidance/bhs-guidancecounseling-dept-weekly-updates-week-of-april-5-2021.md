**April BHS Scholarship Letter** – See attached  
**If your child has not submitted the BHS Scholarship Application and CSS Profile but plans to do so, please submit it very soon.** The application is easy to complete and is available here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdp0n0dznzcGGiZ12S8sfE57lyshVlD\_DOKqlfyjz\_2yK0l1w/viewform and online on the Brookline High School homepage. To make fair decisions, the Scholarship Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com.  Submit the CSS Profile to code 0424 (the Brookline Scholarship Fund) ASAP too.  
The last piece that will be required is your child's financial aid letter from the college they plan to attend. So, once that is decided, have them send Ms Whelan a screenshot/picture of their financial aid letter that college provides (or of their student portal page from the college that shows their financial aid info). Her email is kathleen\_whelan@psbma.org. We know that many students may not make this decision before May 1st.  
Additional Note: The Scholarship Committee uses three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, **unmet financial need**.  There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.    
   
**For Parents/ Caregivers of Seniors -** **THE POST-BHS TRANSITION -- WHAT SENIOR PARENTS NEED TO KNOW**

Current trends, safety tips, practical messaging about alcohol/drug use, and useful strategies for letting go while maintaining open communication will be covered.  
   
**Reminder Updates from Senior Deans Williams, Sudmyer, and Redding:**  
**June 6th Graduation:**  
BHS Senior Deans Summer Williams, Ron Sudmyer and Lisa Redding are working with Hal Mason, Anthony Meyer, and many town and district leaders to create the best commencement experience within guidelines from the CDC, the Commonwealth, and the Town of Brookline. We are investigating several options, including an in-person ceremony, to give our Seniors a “walk across the stage” moment.  As it stands, we have outdoor options on Sunday 6/6, our original commencement date. We will communicate directions and decisions in a more detailed manner soon, so please stay tuned. The Class of 2021 deserves a memorable graduation experience.  
**Celebratory Event:**  
Our Senior PTO members have begun meeting and welcoming volunteers to help plan a gathering for seniors.  This group is also monitoring how other districts are organizing events as well.  **Parents/Caregivers who would like to volunteer to help plan, organize or otherwise contribute should contact our awesome PTO partners at copresidents@bhs-pto.org.**  
**Student Senior Steering Committee:**  
For Seniors who are interested in getting involved, please consider joining our Senior Steering Committee led by Dr. Erin Blette.  The Committee is meeting this Friday, March 26, during X-block. **Please email Dr. Blette for more information or to sign-up at erin\_blette@psbma.org.**  
**Yearbooks:**  
The yearbook staff is working hard to create a book that we hope all will treasure. In order to create the best possible yearbook, we are extending our timeline. Unfortunately, this means that yearbooks will arrive in early July. We know that this may be disappointing and we hope that you can understand that we are doing our best under difficult circumstances. And some of us BHS leaders work throughout the summer so we will consider how to supervise and support a yearbook distribution and signing day even if it is in July.   
We will send out more information and opportunities to contribute soon. For now, here are some important announcements.   
· Yearbook and ad purchase deadlines are extended!   
o   April 16th - New deadline to buy a personalized yearbook  
o   May 1st - Deadline to buy a non-personalized yearbook or donate a yearbook.   
o   May 1st - Deadline to purchase a yearbook ad.   
· Students with free/reduced lunch (documented in Aspen/X2) may purchase yearbooks at a discounted price of $75. Payments must be made by check. Please make checks payable to Public Schools of Brookline and write the student's name in the memo. Checks can be dropped off at the office of the Unified Arts Building (UAB).   
· Pre-ordered books will be shipped directly to home addresses. The price of shipping will be included in your purchase of a yearbook.   
· Yearbook signing for students!  We will offer a virtual yearbook signing in May (just like we did last year). Students will be able to print out their virtually signed pages and add them to their book when it arrives. This year, we will also give students an opportunity to handwrite messages to the class of 2021 and we will add them to the autograph pages (we will also leave blank space for your individual signatures).  
Now that the spring is here and we have received guidance about Graduation Protocols from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), we will be able to move forward in our planning!  We assure you that we will communicate with you as plans take shape.    
   
   
**REGISTER TO VOTE BY APRIL 14th! Anyone who is 18+ can vote.** There is a Select Board election happening MAY 4th, make sure your voice is heard on a local level!

**JUNIORS**  
STUDENTS' SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS FOR HELPING WITH COLLEGE/POST-HIGH SCHOOL PLANNING  
By the second semester of junior year, family stress ramps up significantly as students try to balance schoolwork, study for SATS, look into colleges or other post-BHS options, etc. All of this comes with a lot of internal and external judgment, even during years when COVID is not an issue. How can families be supportive without adding to the pressure? This year’s BHS Peer Leaders have put together some excellent tips to consider in the **Parent Tip Sheet** Student Suggestions to Parents for Helping with College/Post-High School Planning - [https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655](https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655)
