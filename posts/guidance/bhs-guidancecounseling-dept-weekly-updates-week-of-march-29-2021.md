		3/29/2021
	

URGENT REQUEST for all students Grades 9-11:  
If you have not uploaded your 2021-22 course requests to the student portal, PLEASE UPLOAD BY END OF DAY THIS TUESDAY 3/30. Be sure to include elective and wellness course requests plus alternates, considering the required courses/credits needed for graduation. The portal will be closed after this Tues and any changes may not be possible until Fall 2021. You can find the portal instructions attached to this email. After you complete entering your requests, click Post at the bottom of the page. This lets your counselor know that you are finished entering requests.   
Please contact your counselor if you have questions.  
  
Reminder to families to complete [the latest Blackboard survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiHnGwEVMh6vRyduJEvMrFQN-yBdQDgSLMB2D2_KSWY_kLAQ/viewform) (link below) regarding remote vs full in-person by this Tuesday 3/30. BHS Head of School Anthony Meyer communicated on Wed 3/24 - “...Beginning on 4/8/21, BHS will no longer be offering a hybrid option. While this survey deadline is an important one, we will continue to consider individual extenuating circumstances after this date. Although we have offered a great deal of flexibility for good reason this year, we are working to get ahead of DESE who will be mandating districts to prioritize in-person learning, dissolve hybrid approaches, and retain remote learning as an option for students and families who need it” -   

There will be 2 IPRs (progress reports) for this Quarter 3. The first IPR was posted on the portal on Monday 3/8. The second Quarter 3 IPR shares important information for any student who had grades of C or below in any classes as of last Wed 3/24. These Quarter 3 updates are now available on both student and parent portals. The end of Quarter 3 is Tues 4/6 so this week is a critical time for students to do any makeup work, talk to teachers, and do their best work.   
  
The Monday/Friday ½ day PD days (student dismissal at 12:15) are now cancelled. Students will have full school days, starting tomorrow 3/29. Wednesday remote ½ days continue for the next three weeks – 3/31, 4/1, 4/7, 4/14. Beginning Wednesday 4/28 (after April break) Wednesdays ½ days will happen in-person.    
  
See this week’s special schedule due to Friday 4/2 being off for the Good Friday/Easter weekend - attached to this email.  
  
Reminder - District wide PD day for all students K-12 on Tuesday April 6. Students will end their day at 12:40. Special schedule coming soon!

Brookline Scholarship application period ends on April 15. All students who would like to be considered for the BHS scholarships (which are need based) need to submit their scholarship applications and CSS Profile by April 15th.   
The scholarship application link is: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdp0n0dznzcGGiZ12S8sfE57lyshVlD\_DOKqlfyjz\_2yK0l1w/viewform](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/QhRJCo26yKu6B6vAI1GUQ1?domain=docs.google.com) and can also be found on the main page of the BHS website.

If you got into a school and you are 100% sure you will not go there, please let them know (especially if this is a state school).  Colleges are experiencing a huge increase in applications this year, and are therefore using waitlist and deferrals--so your email might help another student get in.

JUNIORS  
STUDENTS' SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS FOR HELPING WITH COLLEGE/POST-HIGH SCHOOL PLANNINGBy the second semester of junior year, family stress ramps up significantly as students try to balance schoolwork, study for SATS, look into colleges or other post-BHS options, etc. All of this comes with a lot of internal and external judgment, even during years when COVID is not an issue.
