**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS- CARETAKERS**  
   
Please note - **all new updates are highlighted in red each week for quick review.** I have included a helpful online article from last year’s Grown and Flown website on “10 things to say to your stressed out teen”. Hoping these suggestions can offer some reassurance to parents as they do their best to support their high schoolers. The goals of the BHS Counseling/Guidance department and the school community overall is to encourage students to try their best in school while keeping their stress levels to a healthy level. If you are ever concerned about your student, please reach out to your student’s assigned school counselor. And….Happy Halloween!  
   
**THE TRUTH ABOUT VAPING – UPDATED PRESENTATION FOR FALL 2019**  
From nicotine addiction to life-threatening respiratory illness, the health risks of e-cigarettes (vapes, juuls) have been all over the news lately, and Brookline is not immune. In fact, vaping among our middle and high school students is on the rise. What do parents need to know? And what can we do to hel

p our kids fully understand that these products are not harmless? Through the generosity of a Brookline community member in collaboration with PSB/ BHS Counseling-Guidance Department, Caron Treatment Centers will present a **special informational parent event tomorrow, Monday October 28 at 7 p.m. in the Brookline High School Auditorium**. Reminder to enter the BHS Auditorium through the Tappan St entrance – see map below. Registration requested at [https://thetruthaboutvaping.eventbrite.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thetruthaboutvaping.eventbrite.com&sa=D&ust=1569589920787000&usg=AOvVaw0eFnaM99p24OQLDRkAduFn)

**Community Service opportunity in Greater Boston area**:  
**The Boston Area Rape Crisis Center (BARCC) is currently recruiting for our 2019-2020 Youth Leadership Corps (YLC).** BARCC’s Youth Leadership Corp is an opportunity for young people to take leadership around the issues of sexual violence prevention and healthy relationship promotion. YLC members will learn about and discuss the ways in which sexual violence impacts their community, as well as how different forms of oppression contribute to the development of sexual violence. This knowledge is then used to create YLC led trainings for other teens, design social media campaigns and engage in community activism.  
**YLC members will receive a stipend for their position. This could be an amazing service opportunity, but not that, because of the stipend, the community service hours acquired cannot count towards BHS community service credits.**  
We are looking for young people who are:  
\-14-19 years old  
\-Interested in developing awareness around sexual violence as it affects their community  
\-Eager to develop their skills in leadership, advocacy, and social change  
\-Capable of working on a team of diverse and open-minded individuals  
\-Open to laughing, with a good sense of humor  
\-Able to meet once every week from 5:00pm-7:00pm; Day of week TBD  
Attached is more information detailing responsibilities and commitments, as well as the BARCC website and YLC application which are hyperlinked above. Please share the attached flyer with students via email, in the classroom and around the school.  
We are currently accepting applications through November 1st! More info here:

**School Pictures/ ID** Makeup Day – Scheduled on Wed, November 6.  
   
**SENIORS**  
   
**Important message to seniors who have applied for EA/ED October/November applications – Please try to avoid INCs or need for grade changes for Quarter 1.** The turnaround time for the guidance office to send out all Quarter 1 grades for early appliers is very short before all staff head out for Thanksgiving break in November.  
**Also for students applying Early Decision- It is your responsibility to notify your counselor about your ED contract** and remind the counselor to sign off on your contract. When you hear back with the college ED decision, please also inform your counselor. We cannot send any grades to other colleges until we know your ED contract no longer applies (ie you did not get accepted to your ED school).  
   
**All Seniors Seminars have now been offered in your advisories since mid-September. If you missed these advisory overviews, please contact your counselor or Lenny Libenzon, BHS College Counselor – room 279/280, for a copy of the BHS College Application Quick Guide and other important details to help you follow the steps for a successful application process.**   
**L Grade** – This BHS policy is most impactful for seniors. If you are struggling in a course and considering moving to a different curriculum level at this time, you will have an L grade on your transcript for colleges.  The L grade policy states:  
**L = If a course level change occurs within ten class periods of the end of a marking period the student will earn a grade of “L” (Late entry) in the new course for that marking period.**  
   
Online College Admissions Test Prep ideas…. FREE! – See attached power point information offered by the amazing Brookline High Librarians!  
   
Please note that college representatives are coming to BHS daily through mid-November. Check your Naviance homepage or stop by the College-Career Center Room 279 for a full listing of all reps and the date/time they will be available in the College-Career Center to meet you! You must have a signed pass from your teacher if you plan to attend during one of your classes. See Mr Libenzon (Room 279/280) or your counselor if you have any questions.  
   
**Transcript release / Teacher-Counselor Recommendation Deadlines**   
To best support every senior in their college admissions process, we require that all seniors meet the deadlines below for communicating to both teacher and counselors re: recommendations.  
**UPDATE**:  If you have college applications with **Nov 1 or Nov 15 deadlines – your transcript release form and other important documents are now overdue**. Counselors and department staff are working hard during and outside of the school day to get your documents ready for these deadlines. **If you got your completed transcript release to your counselor by BHS deadlines and did FERPA and “matching” steps with your Naviance and Common App accounts, then we will meet your deadlines. If you did these steps after BHS deadlines, we will do our best to meet your deadline whenever possible.** Thank you!
