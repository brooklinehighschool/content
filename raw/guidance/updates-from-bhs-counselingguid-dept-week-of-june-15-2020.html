Most colleges will not accept more than 2, and if you ask for more, we can not regulate which letters will go to college and which would not. As you build your college list, you will notice that some colleges only require 1 letter or none at all. These recommendations from both your counselor and teachers will be especially important as we enter into the 2020-21 college application season since this year’s grades and GPA, along many colleges going test-optional, will make recommendations all the more important.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>RESEARCHING COLLEGES REMOTELY</strong><br>COVID-19 has caused campuses to cancel classes, tours and admitted students days. There is no substitute for visiting a campus while it’s in session, attending a class, and talking to current students. However, there are a lot of online resources available to learn as much as you can in the meantime.&nbsp; It is comforting to know that colleges are being really flexible in their typical expectations and policies during the year of COVID-19.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What you can do now from home:</strong><br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign up for college newsletters and updates<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open every email from the colleges you are interested in and click on the links<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reach out to your admissions officers to establish contact and get any questions you have answered<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attend Upcoming Virtual College Admission Events including tours and information sessions - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOAtzZNAjwxoOQbKzMY2JvMll24LQHBXlpV158qQi0U/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;urp=gmail_link&amp;sle=true">Click on this google doc to view a growing list of colleges </a>who have moved their tours and/or information sessions online in the coming weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>BHS Guidance and Special Education Departments recently hosted the virtual "College Supports for Students with Learning Differences" panel last week.&nbsp; </strong>We discussed supports available at colleges and then answered&nbsp;questions from the audience.&nbsp; The panel included representatives from BHS Guidance &amp; Special Education Departments, and&nbsp;Admission Counselors from Curry College and UMass Lowell.&nbsp;<br>Here is the link so view the panel recording - <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/peuUCJ67QAuKvNwvfVGwAT?domain%3Dbhs.brookline.k12.ma.us&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591402812839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0yleCd6GHCpihfehKIKz_x">http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance/college-supports-for-students-with-learning-differences</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Take a physically distant stroll through the beauty of Northeastern's campus and take an unofficial visit to the school while viewing their on-campus arboretum at the same time!</strong> Be sure to call or email the NU Admissions office so they know you took the time to check out their school too.<br><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/04/29/cooped-up-inside-take-a-break-and-take-in-the-spring-scenery-at-northeasterns-arboretum/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591402812839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YcoIv8usoVX2I2HiKE2XS">https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/04/29/cooped-up-inside-take-a-break-and-take-in-the-spring-scenery-at-northeasterns-arboretum/</a><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Coming this Fall 2020 - NACAC Virtual Fair Dates for Students</strong><br>NACAC's inaugural season of virtual college fairs&nbsp;<strong>for students</strong>&nbsp;starts in September.
