**Interested in learning more about potential STEM career paths / research in college?**  
   
Pathways to STEM (P2S) is a free virtual after school program geared towards high school students interested in STEM. Students will be exploring diverse career pathways through research presentations. Northeastern faculty members will be presenting their ongoing research to participants as well as sharing their path to/through college and participants will have time to directly ask faculty questions about the presenter’s research and their field of study. Presentations will be occur via Zoom every Tuesday/Thursday from 4:00-5:00pm for 8 weeks, starting September 28/30th: students can attend as many or as few presentations as they want. Registration for this program is required -> once registered, we will follow-up with information on presenters and a link to the zoom meeting.  
   
For an idea of what topics might be covered, you can look at some of our [past presentations](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/z9l7CXDk5wsjLVn3fkqnte?domain=stem.northeastern.edu/) by faculty. Some of the confirmed presentations this year include, “The Spooky World of Quantum Mechanics”, “Engineering Polymeric Hydrogels”, “Soft Materials and Soft Machines”, and “Home Blood Pressure Monitoring.”
