​**Grade 9, 10, 11 Students**  **- Course Request Information**  
   
From Hal Mason, Assistant Head of School  
The student and parent portals are now open for course registration for the 2019/2020 school year. The deadline for student course requests is Thursday, March 21. You can also watch a short video explaining the course selection process at: [https://youtu.be/NksLUjRkWx8](https://youtu.be/NksLUjRkWx8)  
Please spend some time until March 21 reviewing these important decisions with your child to help choose a strong schedule for next year. Students should also speak to teachers and counselors for course selection advice. Again this year we have asked teachers to spend more time on the “comments” attached to the course recommendations. These comments should give you and your child additional information helpful in creating a balanced schedule. Please remember that students are responsible for knowing and meeting all our graduation requirements.  
The course selections that you make this month determine how we staff the high school. Therefore choose courses carefully and commit to those courses for 2019-2020 as there is not always room to make changes and switches later. Students overriding teacher recommendations must do so by April 2, 2019. To proceed with an override please have your child contact the guidance counselor.

**If your grade 12 student would like to apply for the BHS Scholarships but has not done so already, please have them submit their scholarship application ASAP**. The application is easy to complete and can be found on the home page of the Brookline High School website. After completing the scholarship app, your student's CSS Profile (found on the College Board website) needs to submitted to the Brookline High School Scholarship Program - code 0424. Once students decide which college they will attend next year, they need to either email or bring a copy of their financial aid letter from that college to Ms. Whelan.  
Questions? Please contact Ms. Whelan at her email - [kathleen\_whelan@psbma.org](mailto:kathleen_whelan@psbma.org) or drop off documents to her office is in room 317.  
Please note: The Scholarship Committee would like parents/guardians to know that three criteria are used for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, unmet financial need. There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code #0424  
   
College admissions decisions are now happening! Congratulations to students who are receiving good news! If you are still waiting or have concerns about your admissions decisions so far, please contact your counselor or Lenny Libenzon so we can work with you moving forward. Although waitlist numbers can change dramatically at the same school from year to year, see how many students were on the 2017-18 school year waitlist in this article - [https://www.collegetransitions.com/waitlist-statistics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.collegetransitions.com%2Fwaitlist-statistics&sa=D&ust=1552665353896000&usg=AFQjCNHJ2KsDFPSLWOqPgFn7yaAPXmLtwA)  
   
    
**READ YOUR EMAIL IF YOU HAVE APPLIED TO COLLEGE! Set up and check your portal for each college. If you have questions, students should be contacting the admissions offices, not parents…..
