Phew! What a week of student orientation last week. Teachers and students were working furiously to manage the “next normal” of mostly remote classes for BHS students. Counselors were working feverishly with curriculum coordinators to correct as many student scheduling errors as they could… and will continue to do this work for errors only.  
   
The two week schedule freeze for students asks students to remain in their current schedule UNLESS A COURSE IS MISSING OR WAS NOT REQUESTED will end this Wednesday 9/30**. If a student still desires a “change of mind” schedule change by 9/30, the student should be talking with their parent-guardian and current teacher about a possible change, then contacting their assigned counselor to see if a change is possible when working with curriculum coordinators and deans**. A digital drop/add form is required for signatures from student, parent-caregiver, current teacher, curriculum coordinator, counselor, and dean is required and will start with your counselor, after you’ve talked with your current teacher. **Please note that there may be less ability to drop and add courses this year due to limited seats in classes. Students are also responsible to track their credits to BHS graduation, with the help of their counselor.**

If a student has questions/concerns/or just wants to say hello to their counselor, please see if the counselor has posted their weekly office hours on CANVAS or email the counselor. Counselors have made progress in working through needed schedule corrections, but a few students still are being patient about some issues. Counselors are here and ready to support EVERY BHS student. Students should not hesitate to contact their counselor for any questions or concerns – school related, post high school planning related, extracurricular activities related, or life related!  
   
Reminder -  All NEW UPDATES will be highlighted in BLUE each week for easy scanning of newest info.

The virtual fairs are offered on Oct 12, Oct 18, and Nov 8.** Please see the attached FAQ for more information and next steps. The BHS counselors have not personally attended these fairs, but wanted to share as many options as possible to our seniors as they are the first to navigate this "next normal" of the college admissions process.  
   
Seniors…. Be sure to meet the BHS Transcript Release (and Coun Recommendation info) Deadlines so we can meet your college application deadlines! See the BHS College Application Procedures Quicklist too – both attached below.

Join gap year expert Julia Rogers of EnRoute Consulting for a presentation that will cover the benefits, challenges and opportunities surrounding the gap year option in the era of COVID-19. She will guide attendees through the opportunities available in the age of corona - and how plans could evolve based on the global outlook.
