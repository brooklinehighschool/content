**WE ARE ENTERING THE LAST FULL WEEK OF THE VERY UNUSUAL 2019-20 SCHOOL YEAR. No new assignments will be given to students in any courses this week and students can focus on completing any makeup work in a class or doing optional class options. This will be the last Counseling/Guidance Weekly Update for this school year. Counselors are here to help out, support, and problem-solve with students and parents until June 23, then they too will be off for summer vacation.**  
  
Here is a repeat of the final messages to finish out the school year:  
End of School, 2019-20 In a typical school year, we lose the last week or so of school for final examinations, make-ups, and a last day of school with brief meetings of each class. News flash: this is not a typical year.  
Here is our BHS plan for finishing school that includes important student retrieval of personal items and return of school textbooks, uniforms, and the like.  
\* Monday 6/15-Friday 6/19: Review and make-up; also, retrieval of student belongings and return of school items. (See below.)  
\* Monday 6/22-Tuesday 6/23: Last days of school with schedules for all classes to meet:  
​  
**Monday 6/22**​                            **Tuesday 6/23**  
10:00-10:45 Z Block                 10:00-10:45 D Block  
11:00-11:45 A Block                 11:00-11:45 E Block  
1:00-1:45 B Block                     1:00-1:45 F Block  
2:00-2:45 C Block                     2:00-2:45 G Block  

Student Access to BHS and Return of School Items: Wednesday 6/17-Friday 6/19  
BHS students will be able to access the high school this week to retrieve their belongings and return items borrowed from the school: books, uniforms, and other material. We are planning for tightly scheduled access from Wednesday 6/17 to Friday 6/19. Assistant Head of School Hal Mason has sent a detailed plan, with sign-up specifics and health and safety requirements, last week.

**Here’s information from the well-respected COMPASS Educational Group website about colleges’ acceptances of the new 2020 AP exams for placement**:  
“The \[new AP policy\] announcement… prompted questions about whether colleges would accept the 2020 exams, and if so, how enthusiastically, and on what terms?  Nearly two months after the announcement, many colleges have announced their policies; we’ve tracked, assembled, and coded the policies for over 100 competitive National Universities, and 25 Liberal Arts Colleges, in the table below. We will continue to update this resource as schools release statements about their AP credit policies.”

**BHS GRADUATES – CLASS OF 2020**  
Graduates and their parents - **The BHS Scholarship Process is proceeding but delayed due to the complications of this school year. The Scholarship Committee hopes to notify applicants by email by late June if they will be receiving a scholarship.** Students who have not submitted all the required documentation (the application, CSS Profile, and financial aid letter from the college) cannot be considered for the scholarships. However, applicants who submit remaining documentation now or in the future will still be considered for scholarship assistance. Please contact [Kathleen\_whelan@psbma.org](mailto:Kathleen_whelan@psbma.org) with scholarship questions.  
   
**Koplik** update- The MA Dept of Education (DESE) has made a decision to extend the current May 1 deadline to June 30 and deadlines for the Koplik Scholarship process. The following changes are still tentative according to DESE in regard to the Koplik Certificate of Mastery With Distinction Tuition Credit:  
 \*\* Recent DESE emails have indicated that they would accept August subject test scores for Class of 2020  
\*\* An extension of the usage deadline to Fall 2021 to allow students the opportunity to use the tuition credit  
\*\* Allowance of the tuition credit to be retroactive to the start of the fall 2020 semester for students that may receive certificates after the start of school  
   
**JUNIORS**  
   
Last Thursday 6/11 afternoon, some members of the BHS Counseling/Guidance Dept, including BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon, **offered a well-attended zoom information session with the**  
**UMass Amherst Assistant Admissions Director** **and time for general Q and A regarding college search and planning.  This zoom meeting was recorded and will be sent out to all juniors and parents-guardians later this week.**  
**Some of the questions posed were related to SAT Subject Tests. Since many colleges are no longer requiring Subject Tests as part of their admissions processes, I have included the COMPASS prep website link here to provide more information by college -**  
[https://www.compassprep.com/subject-test-requirements-and-recommendations/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/LpqPCzpxX5cwKk7AIXXCwg?domain%3Dcompassprep.com&sa=D&ust=1592604387376000&usg=AOvVaw1WPVmeeLtGc5iESAYGC_B5)  
  
  
Hamilton College is offering a free webinar/ panel discussion this **Tuesday, June 16 at 7 p.m. (EDT)** called  “**College Search During a Pandemic? You Can Do This!**” Several members of Hamilton’s admission team will address the most common questions and concerns they are hearing and offering tips on how to make the best of these challenging times so that students can tackle their college search with confidence. Students/parents can **[register to attend](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/MDckC82BEAuPWApOC1V3rX?domain=mx.technolutions.net)** on our **[Discover Hamilton website](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/7DtGC9rLgBsNA6ERf3at38?domain=mx.technolutions.net)**.  
  
  
**CollegeBoard (SAT)  provides updates on its tests [on this site.](https://pages.collegeboard.org/collegeboard-covid-19-updates)  ACT provides updates on [its tests here](http://www.act.org/content/act/en/covid19.html).**  
   
The latest from College Board: _Registration opens to all students this week. This year, many centers will have fewer seats because of social distancing guidelines and may encounter unexpected closures. The College Board continues to do all it can to expand availability of the SAT at in-person test centers. We're providing additional SAT administrations every month, beginning in August. There’s higher demand for the August administration, and importantly, in certain areas, August and September already are full or nearing capacity. Certain states have lower capacity, for August in particular, including Massachusetts (at 75% capacity)._  
   
Please note that more and more schools are becoming **test-optional** for the next year and beyond. You do have to check with each school for their requirements, as they tend to change.  For the complete list of test-optional schools, go to [fairtest.org](https://www.fairtest.org/)  
   
**Common Application** **[is keeping the same essay prompts for the next year](https://appsupport.commonapp.org/applicantsupport/s/article/What-are-the-2020-2021-Common-Application-essay-prompts), so you can start working on your essay** (remember, 650 word limit). If you or your family have been impacted significantly by COVID-19 pandemic, common app is adding an optional 250-word essay response: _“Community disruptions such as Covid-19 and natural disasters can have deep and long-lasting impacts. If you need it, this space is yours to describe those impacts. Colleges care about the effects on your health and well-being, safety, family circumstances, future plans, and education, including access to reliable technology and quiet study spaces.”_

Ross Wolfson, the Guidance Coordinator of Westborough HS, conducted two webinars with various college admission representatives to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 on admissions:

[Private Schools Webinar](https://youtu.be/uHmuHoh5kWg)  
   
**Juniors - Please fill out the Self-Description Form before school ends on June 23.** It can be found in Naviance, under About Me: Surveys or a paper copy was part of your Junior Seminar packets handed out before the school building closed. Your counselor needs it to complete your college recommendation so please forward a copy of the form to your counselor by email or send them a quick email so they know you’ve finished the form on Naviance.  
   
**Parents of Juniors: We need the Brag Sheet from you!**  [You can find the form at this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6If7_KxeX3jVnVkWDRmLWxUUUk)   
Please complete and forward to your junior’s counselor before June 23, if possible.   
   
**Juniors - Now is the time to ask two teachers for a recommendation.**  Please note that you only need 2 letters. Most colleges will not accept more than 2, and if you ask for more, we can not regulate which letters will go to college and which would not. As you build your college list, you will notice that some colleges only require 1 letter or none at all. These recommendations from both your counselor and teachers will be especially important as we enter into the 2020-21 college application season since this year’s grades and GPA, along many colleges going test-optional, will make recommendations all the more important.  
   
**RESEARCHING COLLEGES REMOTELY**  
COVID-19 has caused campuses to cancel classes, tours and admitted students days. There is no substitute for visiting a campus while it’s in session, attending a class, and talking to current students. However, there are a lot of online resources available to learn as much as you can in the meantime.  It is comforting to know that colleges are being really flexible in their typical expectations and policies during the year of COVID-19.  
   
**What you can do now from home:**  
·       Sign up for college newsletters and updates  
·       Open every email from the colleges you are interested in and click on the links  
·       Reach out to your admissions officers to establish contact and get any questions you have answered  
·       Attend Upcoming Virtual College Admission Events including tours and information sessions - [Click on this google doc to view a growing list of colleges](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOAtzZNAjwxoOQbKzMY2JvMll24LQHBXlpV158qQi0U/htmlview?usp=sharing&urp=gmail_link&sle=true) who have moved their tours and/or information sessions online in the coming weeks.  
   
**BHS Guidance and Special Education Departments recently hosted the virtual "College Supports for Students with Learning Differences" panel last week.**  We discussed supports available at colleges and then answered questions from the audience.  The panel included representatives from BHS Guidance & Special Education Departments, and Admission Counselors from Curry College and UMass Lowell.   
Here is the link so view the panel recording - [http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance/college-supports-for-students-with-learning-differences](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/peuUCJ67QAuKvNwvfVGwAT?domain%3Dbhs.brookline.k12.ma.us&sa=D&ust=1591402812839000&usg=AOvVaw0yleCd6GHCpihfehKIKz_x)      
  
  
   
   
**Take a physically distant stroll through the beauty of Northeastern's campus and take an unofficial visit to the school while viewing their on-campus arboretum at the same time!** Be sure to call or email the NU Admissions office so they know you took the time to check out their school too.

**Coming this Fall 2020 - NACAC Virtual Fair Dates for Students**  
NACAC's inaugural season of virtual college fairs **for students** starts in September. Students get the chance to learn about different institutions via a mobile experience that is totally intuitive, informative, interactive, and fun.  Student registration for NACAC Virtual College Fairs will open later in the summer. For now, students can [sign up](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/ComqCxk715uxgPRvcwWQKr?domain=go.nacacnet.org) for their email list and they’ll let them know as soon as registration opens. Please note these fall dates:

*   **Sept. 13** \-- **Students Fall Kickoff**
*   **Oct. 12**
*   **Nov. 8**

    
**BHS Grad is offering a FREE College Exploration Opportunity!**

**JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES**  
   
**Lumiry -** **[http://lumiry.com/2020-summer-university-series/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lumiry.com/2020-summer-university-series/&sa=D&ust=1592604387376000&usg=AOvVaw0u-m5lvKP7MRUk4gHL_kwF)**  
An independent educational consultant noticed how the Class of 2021 was being impacted in their college planning.  He recognized the disappointment that high school students were having by missing the opportunity to visit college campuses and felt the need to put together a **FREE summer university series** to connect high school students and parents with admission counselors. **All sessions will be live via Zoom and open to rising 10th – 12th graders.** During each free session, university admissions representatives will share current admission requirements, majors and programs of study, financial aid opportunities, campus life, and much more. Attendees will also have time to ask questions. This is a wonderful opportunity for students to engage directly with universities to gather information to determine if the school could be a good fit!!  
**By sharing this opportunity, please note that Brookline High Guidance does not specifically endorse this company or any other educational consulting or test prep companies.**
