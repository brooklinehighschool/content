​**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS**  
   
Thanks again to everyone who reads these updates from BHS Guidance!  As BHS Guidance/Counseling Coordinator, I plan to continue these weekly updates for the 2019-20 school year. f you have any constructive feedback about these updates, please feel free to contact me individually at darby\_neff-verre@psbma.org.  
   
Another engaging opportunity for BHS students was offered on Tues 4/23 – Day of Mental Health Awareness. Many students joined workshops to build their understanding of mental health issues including the relationship between mental health and school, education around eating disorders, recognizing the impact of mental health in different communities, and overall understanding of and breaking down stigma of mental health concerns. Lastly, the important topic of how to support a friend or family member who you are worried about was emphasized. Important points were noted including finding at least one trusted adult in or out of school to talk to and the importance of letting an adult know if you have concerns about a friend. Never worry alone!  

**URGENT….ALL STUDENTS ENTERING GR 10,11, 12 – If you have not requested your electives or health/ wellness classes for next school year 2019-20. PLEASE EMAIL YOUR COUNSELOR TONIGHT TO LET THEM KNOW YOUR CHOICES,** otherwise you may not get any requests for your schedule next year and will be automatically placed in courses to meet your graduation requirements.  
  
​Student discussions will again be facilitated on the topic of “Truth about Vaping” to approximately 300+ students on Monday 5/20 (rescheduled from 4/22) in Wellness and other classes. Thanks to the Caron Center and a Brookline community member for generously donating the funding for these important conversations offered by BHS Guidance and B-Pen!  
  
**Lunch Lounge continues FOR ALL LUNCHES EVERY FRIDAY (Room 277) AND TUESDAYS (Room 279) THROUGH MID-MAY!** These alternative lunch spaces offer a place for fun conversation, a board game competition, or having your own quiet lunch. **Thanks again for the support from a small group of BHS faculty, interns and our BHS nurses. BRING YOUR OWN LUNCH ON TUESDAYS!**  
Any student can join for one Tuesday or Friday lunch or become a regular. Pizza will continue at the Friday lunches only. Please join us!
