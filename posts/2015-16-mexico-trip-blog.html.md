After the classes today, the certificates ceremony and packing we honored the students and our experience going out for dinner in the Zocalo. We had the whole balcony in front of the Cortés palace for us. The beautiful night and gorgeous view was a gift for our students and teachers. The night was full of laughter, smiles, hugs and good vibes. Students celebrated their camaradership with joy and we surprised Mr. Méndez with a cake for his coming birthday. Our last night was very fun!  
Long day ahead travelling tomorrow,  but from the evening students will be able to share in person their stories and reflections about their adventures to families and friends.

One of the best parts of our stay in Cuernavaca has been the excellent teachers at Cuauhnáhuac. I had the opportunity to be in an individual grammar focused class with Estela. With her help, I think I made some breakthroughs in my Spanish learning. She challenged me with new grammar and vocabulary, she was patient when I made mistakes, and she always encouraged me with a ¨Sí, señorita, perfecto!¨ Estela improved my confidence in speaking because I had a lot of time with her to practice and et helpful feedback. Learning a language is a long and difficult process, but the teachers at Cuauhnáhuac made these two weeks of our language-learning journeys absolutely rewarding and enjoyable.

     To go to another country without my family was scary. I knew it would not be easy. But when I met my host mom, Sra. Zoila, all my worries went away. I was thousand of miles away from home, but the way Sra. Zoila took me in was as if I were right there with my mom. It was the little things that she did that made me feel all right. From making sure I was not starving to making sure I had enough sleep. I thank her so much for making my experience as comfortable as possible.

On Feb 24, the BHS Mexico group went  to Tlayacapan a small town in the state of Morelos. We went to visit a museum where there are 500 year old mummies that had been found in pyramids surrounding their town. They are very famous and well known for being some of the oldest and most intact mummies found in Mexican pyramids. The town of Tlayacapan is a very modest and peaceful place. Within its town they have many work shops of beautiful pottery which is something that the town is known for doing. During this time the students were able to go and explore the small town with large groups. Some focused on buying pottery, others went to eat and try some of their food, and groups went to get frappes and ice cream. There was sometime to relax and kick a ball and to just talk about our experiences here.   
  
During some nights at the Instituto Cuauhnáhuac, we also exchange our stories and experiences with Mexican students who are learning to speak and write in English. The bonds that strangers are able form in a short amount of time is so admirable that by the time we end the conversation we feel like we've known each other for a long time. Being able to use what we are learning in class and putting it in practice gives us inspiration to keep learning and to get better and better. - José

Yesterday was our last excursion to the authentic town of Tlayacapan. Students were able to stroll around the town seeing the locals daily activities, and feeling how life is in a less touristic place. Our visit was calm and peaceful.  
Our Mexican experience is coming to an end, we are trying to savor everything to the fullest before getting back home, the foods, the smells, the slower pace of life, the colors, the differences...  
Today some of us will learn how to cook 'Chiles rellenos' while others continue improving their dancing skills.  
Soon we will leave here quotes from the students reflecting, expressing their impressions on this adventure.

It was fun to hear the laughter and singing in the bus on the way back. These young people know how to get fun from everything.

On Sunday we went to the center of Mexico City to the Templo Mayor, where there was a preserved Aztec pyramid. We explored the many layers of the ruins and the museum nearby.

![Picture](/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/8968346.jpeg?250) 

 During the walk through the ruins we read about Aztec history and stories, especially about different gods and myths. There are a notable amount of sacrifices involved in Aztec history. Pictured on the left is a wall of plaster skulls near the museum entrance. We also saw various artifacts such as ceramic vessels, weapons, jewelry, and paintings, and learned about Aztec culture and trade.  
  
Next we traveled to Teotihuacan, the site of ancient pyramids built by the Aztecs. The two major ones were the Moon and Sun Pyramids. (The one in the picture is the Sun Pyramid, which is the tallest). Though it looked a little daunting it only took about 10 minutes to climb up! There was a really beautiful view at the top.   
  
After we left Teotihuacan we ate at a restaurant nearby and learned about the many uses of the maguey plant, which can serve as natural paper, thread, or lotion. It also is used to produce pulque and agave.   
  
​After the excursion we returned to Cuernavaca and ate dinner with our host families.​ - Alice

On Saturday we went to the Dolores Olmedo Museum, which holds one of the biggest collections in the world of Diego Rivera and Frida Kalho paintings - unfortunately most of Frida's pieces were visiting Russia-.   
Later in the day we went to La Casa Azul in Coyoacán - Frida and Diego's home- most of the students were excited about seeing not only their art but personal objects from the artists and the rooms were they lived and hosted so many other intellectuals and historical figures like Trotsky.  
Walking in the beautiful and lively zócalo of Coyoacán neighborhood was the perfect broach before heading back to Cuernavaca.

Yesterday we visited the market, it was an incredible cultural experience for all of us. Students had astonished faces seeing the different meet cuts and feeling the smells of fresh produce.  
The beautiful of colors of the foods impressed us all, kind locals showed us with pride their merchandise. Markets here seem so alive, full of life, voices, light and people.  
Once at Cuauhnáhuac Estela, at her awesome Cantina, prepares the most delicious foods you can imagine (as you can see in the last picture of this post)
