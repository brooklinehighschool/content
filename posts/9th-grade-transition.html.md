​During construction, we will lose full access to some parts of the high school campus. This includes the existing wing at the corner of Tappan and Greenough, which will be demolished in summer 2019 to make way for our new science wing. This demolition will reduce the number of classrooms at the main campus for the duration of the construction. In order to continue serving over 2,000 students enrolled at Brookline High, we will use the Old Lincoln School (OLS) at [194 Boylston](https://goo.gl/maps/YfrLoDwt2bM2) as an additional building hub for the 9th grade class during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school years.​  
  
​By being at both locations, the Classes of 2023 and 2024 will immediately be able to experience the full range of our academic, elective, social, and support programs and become full members of the BHS community. 9th grade students will be able to take advantage of the depth and breadth of our programs in Career and Tech Education, Performing Arts, and Visual Arts which would not be possible if they were always at OLS. Students will either be part of a cohort that starts every morning at 115 Greenough Street or Old Lincoln School.  Most students will take their elective classes (Performing Arts, Career and Tech Ed, Visual Arts and some World Language) as well as support blocks (Learning Center and Tutorial) at 115 Greenough, and will take most of their major subjects (English, Math, Science, Social Studies, and World Language) at Old Lincoln School.
