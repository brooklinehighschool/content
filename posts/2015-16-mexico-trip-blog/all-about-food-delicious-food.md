Yesterday we visited the market, it was an incredible cultural experience for all of us. Students had astonished faces seeing the different meet cuts and feeling the smells of fresh produce.  
The beautiful of colors of the foods impressed us all, kind locals showed us with pride their merchandise. Markets here seem so alive, full of life, voices, light and people.  
Once at Cuauhnáhuac Estela, at her awesome Cantina, prepares the most delicious foods you can imagine (as you can see in the last picture of this post)
