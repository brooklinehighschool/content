                  <div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">On Jan. 9th, Legislature debated and voted on a proposed headphone bill, sponsored by seniors Omer Fink and Jack Heuberger, which would allow students to use headphones while seated at the indoor picnic tables. This bill was extremely divisive, with people on both sides speaking passionately. The final vote for this bill broke down to 16 Yes, 10 Against, and 2 Abstentions, thereby leading the bill to fail, as bills need a simple majority of the entire body- 18 votes, to pass this year. This vote was not split among students and faculty, with members in both groups voting both for and against the bill. The sponsors of the bill are hoping to revise the bill and repropose it to the Legislature.

Some members of the body are concerned about how this bill would impact students and teachers with the limited meeting times in the current schedule, as there was a case earlier this year where A block did not meet for an entire week. This bill will likely be voted on in an upcoming Legislature meeting.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Additionally, many bills are being drafted and discussed, such as an International Field Trip Attendance Bill, which would excuse absences in the class that sponsors the field trip. For example, students would not receive absences in French for the French Exchange trip. A bill revising how Health and Fitness credits from activities outside the high school are obtained has also been drafted.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Judiciary has also been hard at work this school year. Early this fall, a student approached the Judiciary to consider taking up the issue of collective punishment.&nbsp; Examples of collective punishment include shutting down a bathroom, picnic tables, or library spaces due to the bad behavior of a few students. After weeks of meetings and discussions, the Judiciary will be writing a letter to the administration with their opinions on this matter and potential alternative disciplinary measures that could be taken in lieu of collective punishment.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you are interested in finding out more about what BHS Government is up to on a weekly basis, who your representatives are, or if you have suggested topics for debate, please visit our website.&nbsp; You can find us on the main BHS website under student </span></span><br><span></span><br></div>
