BHS Scholarships (deadline extended to 4/15)  
If you have not submitted the BHS Scholarship Application and your CSS Profile but plan to do so, please submit it very soon. The application is easy to complete and is [available here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdp0n0dznzcGGiZ12S8sfE57lyshVlD_DOKqlfyjz_2yK0l1w/viewform) and online on the Brookline High School homepage. To make fair decisions, the Scholarship Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com.  Submit the CSS Profile to code 0424 (the Brookline Scholarship Fund) ASAP too.  
​  
The last piece that will be required is your financial aid letter from the college you plan to attend. So, once you know this, send Ms Whelan a  screenshot/picture of the financial aid letter that college provides (or of your student portal page from the college that shows your financial aid info). Her email is kathleen\_whelan@psbma.org. We know that many students may not make this decision before May 1st.  
  
Additional Note: The Scholarship Committee uses three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, unmet financial need.  There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.
