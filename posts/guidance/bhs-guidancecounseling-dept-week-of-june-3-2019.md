**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS**  
   
This week of June 3 is June Science MCAS for all 9th graders on Tues, Wed, Thurs mornings. Please be sure to note the changed weekly schedule for all students.  
  
Does a school culture of comparison add more stress and anxiety to our community? Is there a benefit to this culture? Do we want to change it? How do we support students to celebrate their post high school plans – no matter the college, community college, gap year, job, military next step - without feeling badly about what is the best fit for each individual? [Read this short article about how students in Palo Alto CA decided to take a stand](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2019/05/28/palo-alto-high-schools-student-newspaper-opts-not-to-publish-college-map#.XO-opS_wZEs.facebook)
