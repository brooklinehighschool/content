This visit was an opportunity for these students to officially visit the campus and attend an information session, plus enjoy a hearty lunch in the campus dining hall. Many of these students had not visited a college campus officially before, so they were able to learn about this particular university and also begin to sort out what might be important to them as they consider college after BHS graduation.&nbsp;Thank you BHS PTO and parents who donate to the PTO Fund!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>TRANSITIONING TO COLLEGE: EXPERT GUIDANCE AND ADVICE FOR PARENTS OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH ADHD, LEARNING DISABILITIES, AND AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (LEVEL 1) </strong>– see attached flyer for full day parent workshop in Newton, April 6, 2019, Sliding Scale Fee available.

April 3, 2019 at 7 pm in the BHS Auditorium</strong>. Joani Geltman, MSW, an expert in child development and parent-teen relationships, returns to Brookline for “A Survival Guide to Parenting Teens.” Using humor and more than 30 years of experience, Geltman shares stories and advice that defuse some of the anxiety parents feel as their children move through tricky developmental milestones. Parents will learn about setting realistic expectations and appropriate limits, social media “do’s and don’t’s,” and how to identify and deal with teen experimentation with sex, vaping, marijuana, and alcohol. Parents will head home with a greater understanding of their teen’s behavior and needs, as well as very practical parenting tools they can begin to use immediately.
