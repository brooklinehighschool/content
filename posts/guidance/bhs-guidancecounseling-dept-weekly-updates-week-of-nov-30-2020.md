		11/30/2020
	

It’s almost December!  Here’s hoping you and your family had some relaxing and healthy time together either in person or from afar. Students are well into quarter 2 with the midpoint being next Wednesday 12/9. Interim Progress Reports (IPRs) will be communicated by teachers on Thurs 12/10. Now is the time for students to makeup any missed work and to check in their teachers about their progress so the quarter 2 IPR can be positive.   
This is also the time for each of us to be especially patient and kind to friends, family, others in the BHS community, and strangers who pass by every day. Almost all of us have some kind of challenge, struggle, frustration that is making our day to day life a bit harder to manage in these shorter, colder pandemic days. The little acts of kindness we show to each other are gifts that cost nothing. ​

While the focus of Back to School Night #2 last Thursday was on classrooms and teacher messages, the BHS counselors and social workers wanted to introduce themselves too! Here are the videos from these dedicated and caring student support educators from BHS-  
Please note that generally referrals to BHS social workers should be requested through a student’s counselor or dean. Social workers are excellent resources for BHS students AND have very large caseloads at this time, especially this year with the more heightened level of mental health needs in our world. While they would love to have more availability, they are not always able to meet weekly with every student who may ask for this support.   
We encourage families to seek out mental health resources through the Brookline Center or their own health insurance programs. If a student or family needs assistance with this step, please feel free to contact the student’s counselor or one of the BHS social workers.

BHS counselors at both the OLS and 115 Greenough buildings will be present both in person and remotely in our hybrid school plan. Students will be offered a safe, confidential space in the 285 guidance suite and near the 9th grade counselor offices at OLS to set up zoom meetings with counselors and social workers who may be remote on certain days. space to remotely talk with a counselor or social worker.   
Students should contact their counselor directly for more information on how to set up these counseling zoom meetings while in-person at school. Various posters will be shared and posted this week with instructions about how to make appointments and also with QR scan codes that students can use from their phone to automatically connect with their counselor’s or social worker’s phone, email, or zoom office hours space.  
  
Reminder - All NEW UPDATES will be highlighted in BLUE each week for easy scanning of newest info.

Mental health Supports:  
   
Students - Feeling down? Always anxious or worried? Concerned about someone else in your life – friend, family member? Not sleeping well because your mind can’t shut down? If these questions sound familiar, please don’t worry alone.   
Guidance/school counselors and other clinical support staff at Brookline High are here to listen, assess, and support you so you are not carrying these burdens alone. Please reach out to your counselor. You can also reach out to a BHS faculty member (including Darby Neff-Verre – Coordinator of BHS Guidance/Counseling) to start the conversation about how we can help you build strategies or get connected to feel safe and better about your situation. Contact your counselor at their email, zoom visiting hours, or phone.  
   
Expert Advisory Panel 2 on Support to Address the Whole Child Experience will post a tip each week to support caregivers during this time.  
Often, the tools and techniques we use to help us relax and ‘take down the volume’ (going for a walk or run, taking an exercise class, listening to music, talking to a friend, being by ourselves) aren’t possible or don’t work in situations when we need them most. If you’re helping your child with remote learning at the same time you’re on a work call, you can’t go for a run or turn on your favorite music. Instead:  

*   Do a couple of body stretches   
    
*   Shake out your hands, arms, legs to release tension,   
    
*   Consciously release your jaw  
    
*   Literally shift your focus: If you’re feeling stressed, turn away from whatever you’re doing (computer screen, your child or partner) if only for a couple of seconds, and shift your gaze. This can be enough to disrupt the cycle  
    

Take one task at a time as much as possible to avoid overwhelm, knowing that sometimes we need to power through difficult situations in the best ways we can.  
  
HandholdMA.org is a new online initiative from DMH/CBHI to provide comprehensive, accessible, multi-lingual mental health information for parents, caregivers, and families. Parents-caregivers know their child better than anyone. You may still have a few questions. COVID-19 is putting incredible pressure on families. You might be noticing your child is struggling in new ways, or that old problems are getting worse.  
It answers common questions such as, 'Should I worry?' 'What can I do?' and 'Who can help?'   
Here's the link: [https://handholdma.org/](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/nWWFC68z9yc1BYVVup3UHa?domain=handholdma.org/)  
   
Family Support Groups offered by BRYT Central. These groups will happen three times a week and will remain open to all parents (not just parents of BRYT students). There is now a Spanish language group up and running.  
Currently, the times are:   

*   Tuesdays at 7:00 PM   
    
*   Wednesdays at 7:30 PM  
    
*   Thursdays at 12:00 PM

Thinking of changing sending an ACT or SAT test score after you’ve applied test optional?   
BHS Counselors are advising students to call each school that they are applying to ask how to manage shifting from test optional to sending scores because there does not seem to be common practice in admissions offices.   
  
  
  
  
SENIORS – READ YOUR EMAILS!   
ALSO BE SURE TO FOLLOW ANY APPLICANT PORTAL DIRECTIONS for colleges you will be applying to, if they have a portal protocol. Your efficiency in opening up these accounts after applying is sometimes monitored by admissions offices to gauge your level of interest!  
  
MEFA financial aid events will all be online this fall.  BHS Guidance partners with the Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (MEFA) each year to provide families with a wealth of financial aid information. This year, due to the global pandemic, MEFA will not be sending their speakers out to high schools. Please visit [https://www.mefa.org/events](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/-O6zCo26yKuBRLQqi1dF7y?domain=mefa.org) to investigate upcoming webinars and take a look at their very informative website.   
  
Seniors - Please review your unofficial transcript for any missing classes or errors. Contact your counselor with any questions or concerns.  
It is your responsibility to be sure your transcript is accurate before giving BHS permission to send to any colleges or post HS grad programs.  
You should be checking that you are earning all required credits towards graduation this June 2021 too.  
English- 4 credits  
Science - 3 credits  
Social Studies/History - 3 credits including US History  
Math - 3 credits (4 years required for UMass State colleges/universities)  
World Language - 2 credits (same language)  
Elective - 3 credits distributed across Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Career/Tech, Community Service  
Wellness - .5 Lifetime Wellness, 3 - .25 wellness credits  
\+ additional credits to earn minimum total credits of 22  
We will not be sharing any GPA information with colleges on official transcripts. See your Naviance account for your current “working” BHS GPA.  
  
College Application Reminders:  
  
Help the BHS counselors and teachers support your application process by meeting these deadlines. Submit your electronic transcript release forms, your self-questionnaire, your parent/caregiver’s “brag” sheet, and give notice to your teachers who have agreed to write recommendations for you.  
If you have college application deadlines for 12/1 and 12/15, you have not yet completed a transcript release request, please do this step and contact your counselor immediately to confirm. Also connect with your teachers regarding recommendations since you are behind in informing these critical BHS staff people who want to do their best to support your college application process.  
  
College Deadline                     BHS Deadline  
January 1                        Monday November 30   
(includes no school December break)  
January 15                        Wednesday December 9  
February 1                         Wednesday January 6  
February 15                        Friday January 15  
  
Seniors – When submitting your transcript release forms electronically, please:  

*   use the updated link shared by your counselor (on their CANVAS page or by email)  
    
*   be sure to list your college names and addresses CORRECTLY AS THEY APPEAR OFFICIALLY ON THE COLLEGE’S WEBSITE OR NAVIANCE. The processing of your request is slowed down by not including the official name of the college or putting in wrong information.  
    

  
SENIORS AND JUNIORS  
Great quick read from Grown and Flown about college fit in the college search process \- written by Adam Weinberg, President of Denison University in Ohio (so there is some Denison specific encouragement). The article also does not cite virtual college search and visit expectations at this time due to the pandemic….but helpful for juniors/seniors and their parents-cargivers to consider \- [How to Help Teens Find a Good College Fit, From a University President](https://grownandflown.com/college-fit-why-important/?utm_source=Grown+%26+Flown+Email+Subscription&utm_campaign=fd9c472e65-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_07_01_34&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fc15798a65-fd9c472e65-246876214)
