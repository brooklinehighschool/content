**9 IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO IF YOU’RE PLANNING TO APPLY TO COLLEGE NEXT YEAR –**  
**June and Summer 2021…**

1.  **Be sure you can log into your Naviance account before the summer.** If you forgot your login info, email your counselor or Lenny Libenzon (BHS College Counselor).
2.  **Be sure to talk with 2 of your current junior year teachers to see if they are willing to write you a “good” recommendation for your college application.** Thank them too! If you are not sure of who to ask, make an appointment with your counselor before the school year ends.
3.  **Complete the Jr Questionnaire.** This information is **required** for your counselor to write your college recommendation. You can complete this questionnaire now or over the summer and you can go to your Naviance account under surveys. Email your counselor when you’ve completed the questionnaire.
4.  **Have one (or both) parents-caregivers complete the attached Parent Brag Sheet and return to your counselor now or in Sept.**
5.  **Keep researching and building your college list.** Remember you should be building a list of approx. 8-10 colleges to apply to with 3 being “reach” schools, 4 being “target/ 50-50” schools and 3-4 being “likely” schools that you would be very happy to attend!
6.  **Keep signing up for virtual college info sessions and visits. Also, many colleges are now opening up for in-person info sessions and tours so go to the college’s website and sign up!** If you plan to drive through a college’s campus, be sure to stop by the admissions office or email the office to let them know you were on the campus, even the colleges in the greater Boston area.
7.  **Start brainstorming a rough draft of your college essay.** Class of 2022 Common Application essay prompts attached to this email.
8.  **Start completing the Common Application after the first week of August.** This effort will be well worth it so you don’t have to stress about completing after your senior year courses start! You can also see if any colleges you are applying to require essay supplements and start brainstorming those as well.
9.  **Be sure you have registered for any college admissions testing (SATs or ACTs) you may need to apply to schools of interest.** Keep in mind that MOST colleges are still **test optional** for the Class of 2022. You may not NEED test scores to apply.

    
   
**Start becoming familiar with financial aid information – Check out MEFA (MA Educational Financing Authority) - FREE state funded college financial aid information resource** \- [https://www.mefa.org/financial-aid-made-simple](https://www.mefa.org/financial-aid-made-simple)  
   
STUDENTS' SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS FOR HELPING WITH COLLEGE/POST-HIGH SCHOOL PLANNING  
By the second semester of junior year, family stress ramps up significantly as students try to balance schoolwork, study for SATS, look into colleges or other post-BHS options, etc. All of this comes with a lot of internal and external judgment, even during years when COVID is not an issue. How can families be supportive without adding to the pressure? This year’s BHS Peer Leaders have put together some excellent tips to consider in the **Parent Tip Sheet** Student Suggestions to Parents for Helping with College/Post-High School Planning - [https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655](https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655)
