**Nicole L. Bent**     
Guidance Counselor    
It all started in the spring of 1976. As our nation geared up for the bicentennial, two young guidance counselors gave birth to a guidance counselor of their very own. Not unlike many genetically engineered prodigies, Ms. Bent did not initially embrace her destiny. After majoring in English at Mary Washington College, Ms. Bent ventured out into the oh-so-sexy world of help wanted advertising and looked forward to the opportunities to flex her writing muscles. After a year and a half of writing job descriptions, Ms. Bent could no longer continue to deny her fate. The DNA coding was too strong. She went back to school and earned a Master of Education in School Counseling from Suffolk University and began working at Brookline High School in the fall of 2001. In the spring of 2008, in an effort to keep her game tight Ms. Bent obtained her administrative license and a Master of Education in Organizational Management from Endicott College.
