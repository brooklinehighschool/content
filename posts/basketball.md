Our Program
-----------

Brookline High School offers three levels of both boys and girls basketball teams.  Players are expected to be present for all games and practices. Now, that being said, we understand that occasionally circumstances arise and reasonable considerations must be made. We ask only that you communicate with us as early as possible and understand that even an excused absence may sometimes result in punitive action. An absence from a game or practice about which we were not given prior notice (excepting emergencies, of course) will be subject to sanctions up to and including suspension from future games. A second violation could result in termination from the program. An authorized absence from school due to unexpected illness counts as prior notice.  
  
For those players and parents new to the program, the general guideline that has always been followed is that personal business should be scheduled on personal time if at all possible. We also expect that in season, basketball will take priority over other sports and activities. As for academic responsibilities, many of us on the coaching staff are teachers ourselves, so we understand the role basketball plays in one’s overall school experience. We also know, however, that a player who takes these responsibilities seriously will rarely, if ever, find himself in a situation in which school and basketball conflict. Again, communicate early to avoid problems.  
  
The Brookline High School Basketball program takes very seriously the question of participation in games and practices over the December and February breaks. We strive to be respectful of and sensitive to family events and other occasions that take place during school vacation times, but we also must stress that ours is a sport in which competition during and immediately after these vacations is the norm.  
  
To start with, we take a different approach to the Varsity and sub-varsity levels. For the JV and 9th grade teams, the season usually ends the Thursday before February vacation. There are scheduled games and practices over December break, but players at this level may be absent during the break due to family holiday commitments without any punitive action being taken. All we ask is that you have the courtesy of informing us about your particular situation as far in advance as possible.  
  
Most years, the Varsity regular season ends right at February vacation, but we hope to continue into the postseason. If so, we will practice over February break. Also, there are games and practices scheduled for Varsity over December break. Accepting a place on the Varsity means committing to these dates. Reasonable requests to be absent from vacation practices without penalty – for instance, to see out-of-state grandparents over the holiday - will be considered, especially if the request is made as early as possible. A family cruise or ski vacation over February break, though, as another example, will not be considered. Games are, of course, mandatory..
