_**We  arrive at Cuernavaca in the early morning after a sleepy two hour  bus ride from   
  
    Mexico  City.  Our “families” await us  at  Cuahunauac school.  Estefanía, one of the   
  
    teachers ,  quickly  sorts out the students and hands  them off to the   
  
    families they will be staying with.  After introductory hugs all around,  we head    
  
    to our new homes in Colonia Quintana Roo  directly  across from the school where   
  
    the streets  have  names like Cancun, Cozumel and Xel-ha   
  
          We catch up on our sleep and by 1 o’clock in the afternoon,   we reconvene at   
  
    the school.  Everyone looks rested and ready for our Mexican adventure to begin,     
  
    to  enter this world of warm sun, gentle breezes, and flowers  of all shapes and   
  
    colors. After a brief orientation by David Cano Jr  the director of the  school, we   
  
    board the bus for our first excursion, the nearby town of  Tepoztlan.  
  
          Tepoztlan is a historic town with all the classic elements of the towns founded by  
  
    the Spanish in the new world : a cobblestone main street lined with colorful shops  
  
    selling  handmade crafts, and practical things.  It has an impressive stone church,   
  
    with a shady front yard across the street from the town market where piles of    
  
    chiles, mountains of fruit  compete for space with cooking utensils, and   
  
    tables piled high with  music cds from all over  the Spanish speaking world.   
  
    We break into two groups – a smaller  one who wants to explore the town  
  
    and a larger one that wants to climb El Tepozteco, a big hill at the end of the main   
  
    street  that offers a 45 minute hike (for people in good shape) to the top  where  
  
    there is a multilayer pyramid to the Aztec god of pulque, Tepoztecatl.     
  
    It’s a challenging climb for my 56 year old legs but the hike is worth it.  We leave the   
  
    bustling world  of Tepoztlan and enter a beautiful  natural world of tall trees and   
  
    song birds and lots of  people of all shapes and sizes, many of whom (including   
  
    myself) huffing and puffing  their way up to the top.  El Tepozteco  does not   
  
    disappoint.  The pyramid is perfectly symmetrical and  has weathered the centuries   
  
    intact.  The  view of the Tepoztlan   valley is breath taking.    
  
                We walk back with wobbly legs but satisfied having conquered the mountain.    
  
    It’s almost dark by the time we get back to our bus. We’re tired, but happy with how   
  
    our first day in Mexico has gone.**_
