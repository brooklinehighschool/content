The application has now opened!<br>&nbsp;<br>The Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) is an AmeriCorps program dedicated to increasing youth academic enrichment and college and career exploration through Out-of-School-Time (OST) interventions and data-driven programming. We are a passionate team that strives every day to empower young people to succeed as part of a national movement to achieve education equity. We do this because we believe that all young people have a right to Caring Adults, Safe Spaces, A Healthy Start, An Effective Education, and An Opportunity to Serve.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a Mass Promise Fellow, participants serve at one of our partner youth-serving programs at schools, city agencies, or community-based organizations in Massachusetts. Their mission will be to build intentional relationships with young people between 6th and 12th grade and support their academic engagement or post-secondary success. Fellows will work to decrease the dropout rate, close the opportunity gap, and support the futures of youth. If someone believes in the power of relationship building to positively impact the life of a young person, this role is for them.<br>&nbsp;<br>MPF's training curriculum, networking opportunities,&nbsp;and career coaching provide our Fellows with the opportunity to increase their leadership development and gain meaningful skills needed for careers in the education and non-profit sectors.&nbsp;On average, 25% of Fellows are hired by their host site for full-time employment following their year of service. Within three months of graduating from MPF, 95% of our Fellows have full time employment or are continuing school.<br>&nbsp;<br>Students can learn more about MPF, the benefits of our program, and our host sites across Massachusetts at&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/yT4pCo26yKu6zD55hzV_JR?domain=nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com">https://masspromisefellows.org/apply</a><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>JUNIORS</u></strong><br><strong>Another brief article on considerations for college search and applications – 8 Factors to never consider when choosing a college</strong> - https://www.collegedata.com/resources/getting-in/8-factors-to-never-consider-when-choosing-a-college?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=8_factors_to_never_consider&amp;dm_i=50NV,E8CM,2HLH1D,1HMPF,1<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Start becoming familiar with financial aid information – Check out MEFA (MA Educational Financing Authority) - FREE state funded college financial aid information resource </strong>- <a href="https://www.mefa.org/financial-aid-made-simple">https://www.mefa.org/financial-aid-made-simple</a><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Brimmer &amp; May School is happy to announce their first&nbsp;<strong>College Essay Writing Bootcamp</strong>&nbsp;this summer!
