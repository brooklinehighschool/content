                <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span>If you are keeping your child home because of COVID-19 symptoms, please be sure to inform your school nurse, and share specific information about symptoms. Many families have indicated that their student "has a cold". However,<strong>&nbsp;since the symptoms of COVID-19 mimic those of a cold</strong>, we ask that you strictly follow the symptom protocols, consult your pediatrician as indicated, and follow the protocols for returning to school, which are included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Z4L1ClYM7LuLp4Kgt9N886?domain=docs.google.com" target="_blank">updated FAQ.</a></span><br><span></span><span><strong>In addition, if you have not signed your child up for Test and Stay, we ask that you do so now.</strong>&nbsp;It has been quite time-consuming for nurses to reach out to families for testing consent while implementing the testing program when in-school close contacts have been identified. We can no longer accept a one-time verbal consent.&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/STdvCmZMy6IvD4YETBty1j?domain=cic-health.com" target="_blank">Click here to sign up today.</a></span><br><span></span><span>The Test and Stay program, supported by DESE, and following their rules, do not allow fully vaccinated individuals to participate in the Test and Stay program, as those individuals do not need to quarantine. We realize that keeping an ill child home isn't always easy. Your commitment to this is helping to keep the numbers of COVID-19 positive cases in our schools low.</span><br><span></span><span>Finally, we continue to offer COVID-19 vaccination clinics for those eligible (anyone 12 years or older). As we have done in previous clinics, PSB will be administering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals who are eligible for a Pfizer booster shot may also sign up for an appointment at this clinc. Our next clinic is on&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, October 27,&nbsp; 6:30-7:30 pm at Lincoln School.</strong>&nbsp;We are prepared to expand those hours if there is a need.&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Wj2LCn5NOXSnjBLMTZjBW7?domain=appointmentquest.com" target="_blank">You can sign up for an appointment here.&nbsp;</a></span><br><span></span><span>We will continue to keep you informed should any changes to our practice or protocols occur.</span><br><span></span><span>Sincerely,</span><br><span></span><span>Student Health Services Team<br>The Public Schools of Brookline</span><br><span></span><br>â€‹.&nbsp;</div>
