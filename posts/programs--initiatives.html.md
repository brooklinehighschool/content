**ACE (Alternative Choices in Education)**  
ACE is an innovative, _competency-based program_ at Brookline High School for up to 50 students, entering grades 10-12, who feel they will find more intellectual satisfaction and be more academically successful in a non-traditional setting.  ACE provides a rigorous college-preparation pathway in which students are placed in multi-age classes based on their skill levels and can go at their own pace and graduate when they complete their content and skill competencies.

**African American & Latino Scholars Program (AALSP)**  
The African-American & Latino Scholars Program at Brookline is designed to enhance the culture of high achievement among students of color. It is about helping Brookline High School reach its fundamental academic goal, an achievement profile that reflects the diversity of our student body. This program is generously supported by the BHS Innovation Fund.

**Brookline High School Tutorial**  
Brookline Tutorial is a one-credit course offering content area academic support for 10th through 12th grade students with the overarching goal of maximizing student achievement. Each class section (comprised of ten students with two content area teachers) meets four times a week in a supportive learning community.  In collaboration with their Tutorial teachers, students identify specific goals for improving academic performance and receive individual guidance in developing effective study strategies. Class time is divided between personalized consultation (in which a Tutorial teacher assists the student in identifying more effective and efficient study habits) and independent practice (where the student implements recommended strategies).  
For more information, contact [Joanne Burke](mailto:joanne_burke@psbma.org)  
  
**BRYT**  
BRYT (Brookline Resilient Youth Team) is an initiative to support the reintegration of students who have been out of school and/or hospitalized due to an emotional, medical, psychiatric, or substance related issues. It is led by a collaborative of parents and staff from Brookline High School and the Brookline Center.  [More Information](https://www.brooklinecenter.org/services/school-based-support/bryt-program/)  
  
**The Calculus Project**  
The Calculus Project is unlike any initiative in public education that aims to close the achievement gap in mathematics. In particular, the project is designed to increase the number of African American and Latino students who enroll and succeed in high level mathematics courses at Brookline High School, culminating with the study of calculus in their senior year. This initiative originates in middle school and offers a series of focused innovations that continue throughout high school.  These include summer preview courses that support skill building, reduce summer loss, and prepare students for their subsequent mathematics course by introducing them to core mathematical concepts vital to their success; afterschool tutoring during the school year, where highly qualified mathematics teachers re-teach and reinforce concepts and skills; and the development of “cohorts” that serve to create a less stigmatized academic culture, enhance the aim of striving toward calculus, and provide support among the target population. If you have questions about the Calculus Project or want to join, please contact [Meghan Kennedy-Justice](mailto:meghan_kennedy-justice@psbma.org) and [Lisa Rodriguez](mailto:lisa_rodriguez@psbma.org)  
  
**China Exchange**  
The Mission of the Brookline High School China Exchange Program is to foster personal connections and a climate of mutual cultural understanding between the people of China and the United States. Each year, the China Exchange Program brings a group of eight high school students and one teacher from the Gao Xin School in Xi’an, China for a semester at Brookline High School, and a comparable group from Brookline High School to the Gao Xin School. The program provides participants with an opportunity for personal growth through increased cultural awareness, foreign language competency, and the maturation associated with navigating a new environment. The China Exchange Program enriches the communities of both schools far beyond the impact on the students and teachers who have directly participated since its inception in 1999. The program has fostered a much broader set of personal relationships among members of the two cultures involving school and community leaders, students and faculty, host families and other community members. It is also a powerful symbol of and focal point for the value that Brookline and Xi’an place on mutual understanding in an increasingly interconnected world.

**Global Leadership Program**   
The Global Leadership Program aims to prepare students to understand the challenges of the 21st Century, and to lead for a more prosperous, equitable and peaceful world. The Program includes a class and several trips and a club.  Students may participate independently in any of the activities.  Any student may apply to participate in a trip. The class is open to 10th-12th graders and students must apply the previous March for acceptance to the class. The trips are designed to provide students with exposure to leaders in human rights, public health and other work that is global in nature, and to cultivate cultural awareness and cross-cultural communication skills.  The course emphasizes recent and current global challenges and exposes students to professionals committed to addressing war crimes, epidemics, and development. Further, students will work frequently in groups and collaborate on design and problem solving challenges, and will practice debate, negotiation, data analysis and leadership. In all of the Program activities, students will develop a global perspective and gain greater insight into the complexity and urgency of challenges that are a concern to us all.

**Social Justice Leadership**  
The Brookline High School Program in Social Justice Leadership trains a youth corps of social justice advocates and aims to nurture life-long leaders for social transformation—a powerful antidote to the recent decline in civic engagement and a response the growing demand by students to learn about and work for social justice.  Participating students will grapple with the bedrock values of social justice—Commitment, Courage, Compassion, Humility, Praxis—and produce a social justice mission statement.  Students will attend a bi-weekly seminar, blog and journal online, participate in trainings and intern at a local social justice organization.  These experiences emphasize collective rather than individual responses to injustice, and transformative rather than temporary relief from social problems.  The program is supported by The 21st Century Fund and is open to all juniors and senior applicants who can demonstrate maturity, a desire to participate, and a proven ability to fulfill commitment.

**The Whipple Writing Fellowship**  
The Whipple Writing Fellowship offers Brookline High Students who love the written word an opportunity to develop and expand their skills as writers. As Fellows, participants join a supportive cohort of fellow aspiring writers, receive a generous stipend to encourage their work, and learn from professional writers from across a spectrum of writing styles on how to craft a piece of writing that will ultimately be presented in a public forum and submitted for publication.  The 8 Whipple Fellows are chosen through an application process in the spring and complete their fellowship by the end of the summer. The program will also offer additional writing workshops throughout the school year to help student writers hone their writing skills.
