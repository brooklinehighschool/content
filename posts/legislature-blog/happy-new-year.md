This blog post is brought to you by:  Zach Gale, Sophomore, Member of Student Council  
Leading up to winter break, Student Council continued to analyze the results of the surveys you filled out. We are using the data from the surveys to write bills to address your concerns and interests. Student Council also met with Faculty Council to discuss several pending bills including: the [Sick Absence Bill](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T1KqwH3msLiBUXzDSnm1g0dKBFB5JjraQQC2yguqJOk/edit), [Right to Rest Bill](https://docs.google.com/document/d/183BrRUq0aEFpRqrF-GmNSULkjysCpFK2MlXOyAnfWCA/edit), and [Test Grade Transparency Bill](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yhMEgTRygkbXYoIMDu3QxrZKSLntK1LSKLlKGThqDAI/edit).  Other pending bills include the [Student Council and Faculty Council Meeting Amendment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6fTbSbdRUFpESkbjif5u38q-75VEgAiFyDkndL9jPg/edit), [Grade Rounding Bill](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tf98WXiyL4jO5mNyvRGwgM9mF3tYR5ENt1pOv_i0Osw/edit), and the Judiciary Reform Bill.
