  <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">Our Program</h2>
  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;">The Performing Arts Department at Brookline High School is a thriving and lively home for creative expression. We offer courses and extra curricular activities in drama, dance, stagecraft, tech, instrumental music, chorus, and digital music in introductory through advanced levels. Our programs support those who are passionate about a particular performing art, as well introducing students to areas they are not familiar with and may fall in love with through their experience in our classes. Performing Arts gives everyone a voice and teaches communication skills as students learn to work independently and in an ensemble. In addition to learning technique in our different disciplines, students collaborate, problem solve and develop their ability to think critically and creatively - skills that will carry over to all areas of their lives, while having a lot of fun in the process! Students who participate in Performing Arts at BHS develop their artistic technique and vision, and they learn that through working collaboratively, we can create a whole greater than the sum of its individual parts.<br><br><br>Through a variety of courses in Dance, Drama, Stagecraft, Vocal, Instrumental and Digital Music, the Brookline High School's Performing Arts teach self-discipline, reinforce self esteem, develop cooperative learning, encourage curiosity, and foster the creative thinking and problem solving skills that are so necessary for students as they grow and mature.<br><br>Performing Arts courses provide students the opportunities to:<br><br><strong><u>Explore and Discover</u></strong><br>• Connect their imagination with the deepest questions of human existence:&nbsp; Who am I?&nbsp; What must I do?&nbsp; Where am I going?<br><br><strong><u>Develop Craftsmanship</u></strong><br>• Through practice, focus and problem solving, find new ways to communicate with intent:&nbsp; present ideas and issues, to teach, to persuade, to enjoy, and to entertain.<br><br><strong><u>Engage in Community</u></strong><br>• Develop the attitudes, characteristics, communication, and critical thinking skills required to effectively participate in a&nbsp;complex and ever changing society.<br><br>In addition to the daily course work, the Performing Arts Department provides many extra-curricular opportunities for students in Drama productions, Music concerts, and Dance presentations.&nbsp;</div>
