Freshman Year  

----------------

  
  
**Ninth grade (freshman) seminars** focus on orientating students to the school's policies and expectations.  Graduation requirements are reviewed and students are oriented on their Naviance accounts.  The process of self exploration begins as students are asked to complete the "Learning Style" survey on Naviance and they are asked to fill out the "Personal Assessment Questionnaire".  Good study habits are reviewed and the role of the guidance counselor is explained.  Part of the Seminar expectation is that students will schedule one face to face meeting with their counselor using Naviance and email.  Seminar meetings in the ninth grade are held during the advisory period beginning in late October.
