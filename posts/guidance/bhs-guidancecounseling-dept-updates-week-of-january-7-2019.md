**ALL STUDENTS**  
How about a New Year’s Resolution to consistently get more sleep? It will help your physical, emotional, and academic health… and you’ll be happier too!   [https://childmind.org/article/help-teenagers-get-sleep/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fchildmind.org%2Farticle%2Fhelp-teenagers-get-sleep%2F&sa=D&ust=1546708024472000&usg=AFQjCNEH2XcUyhJ3G2wXYPUCPF2ADUjKjg)  
   
BHS wiSTEM Club offers: **High School 101 Workshop: Midterms - Preparation Tips and Tricks from Upperclassmen and teachers!**  January 10, X block, Room 261   
   
_Join the Friday Lunch Lounge!_ Want a different place to eat lunch?  
You are invited to come to room 277 on Fridays to hangout, play games, and meet some new people. Bring your lunch. Snacks provided!  We are looking forward to meeting you!  
   
**SENIORS  
Early Decision acceptances - please contact all colleges also applied to EA/RD and remove your name from their lists...and congrats!**  
  
**Deferred to regular decision?** Please carefully read advice from the BHS Guidance Department [about next steps – attached here.](/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/deferred_or_waitlisted__suggested_next_steps.pdf)   

If you haven’t already, **please say thanks to your teachers and counselor who supported you by writing recommendations** for your application process. Just saying stopping by to say thanks and let them know where you stand with admissions or writing a quick note make a BIG difference to those who helped you!  
​  
As College Counselor Tara Anne Dowling suggests-  
“Say 'Thank you' as well as 'No, thank you'   
\--‘Thank you for taking time with my credentials’, ‘thank you for answering my questions’, ‘thank you for offering me a scholarship’ etc.  
\--‘No, thank you, I will be attending another college’ (you can say the name of your attending college if you feel comfortable)  
This is done in myriad ways:  
\* via the online portal they may give you the option to decline your offer and say where you are going  
\* via email to the rep who has been working with you  
\* via post--did you get a big packet in the mail? There may be a postcard that asks for you to respond with info if you are declining the offer  
   
What is goodwill and why does it matter?  
\--Admission officers very often become invested in the students they are reviewing. They have read your file, recommended you to the admission committee, and perhaps put you up for a scholarship. Hard work deserves a big thank you.  
\--You never know if you may need to transfer  
\--You may have a younger sibling or friend who will attend this university. How can a good relationship that helps other people be a bad thing?  
  
What's in it for me?  
\--If good will doesn't move you (or good manners!) then think of kids on waitlists who are dying to find out if they can have that place that is currently being held by you. You can help colleges clean up their records and make room for other candidates!"  
   
**Scholarship Information –** Brookline High scholarship info and other resources – see attached info, BHS Guidance website, and BHS Homepage  
   
**READ YOUR EMAIL IF YOU HAVE APPLIED TO COLLEGE!** **Set up and check your portal for each college. If you have questions, students should be contacting the admissions offices, not parents….. See this article for more info about documents to college -** [**http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2018/11/21/parents-before-you-yell-at-your-childs-school-counselor/**](http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2018/11/21/parents-before-you-yell-at-your-childs-school-counselor/)  
   
If you **change your admissions requests or decide not to apply to a college on your original transcript release form**, PLEASE NOTIFY YOUR COUNSELOR OR STOP BY ROOM 161 (Main Guidance Office) so we can update your requests.  
   
**Transcript release / Teacher-Counselor Recommendation Deadlines**   
**Upcoming due dates:**  
College deadline                                            BHS Deadline

February 15                                                                               Friday, January 18  
   
**Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college?** You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please see Kate Cordner, the BHS Career Counselor, on Tues- Friday in Room 279 or 280 for more info.   
   
**“Is it a Scam?” – Scholarship and other financial aid scams - Federal Trade Commission** - [**http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0082-scholarship-and-financial-aid-scams**](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0082-scholarship-and-financial-aid-scams)

**JUNIORS**  
   
ALL JUNIORS!  **PSAT results** are now available online via the College Board website. Students who took this practice test should have received an email from the College Board to announce that scores are available and to provide directions for access. . If a student cannot access their account, they should try the "forgot the password" feature first. If that doesn't work, Lenny Libenzon can help students with access when they drop by College-Career Center 279 or his office 280  
   
To better understand the information on the score reports, students and parents can view PSAT video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQGjsOQGpU-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQGjsOQGpU-)   
  
Students can contact their counselor for more information – stop by, leave a note, send an email if they are not available.   
**WE ENCOURAGE ALL JUNIORS TO DO A FEW THINGS AFTER VIEWING THEIR SCORES:**  
1- MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR COUNSELOR TO DISCUSS SCORES AND START THINKING ABOUT COLLEGE PLANNING  
2- USE THE FREE ONLINE KHAN ACADEMY LINKED TO THE PSAT REPORT TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORES
