**Junior Year Calendar and Standardized College Admissions Testing presentation -** Tuesday, December 11, 2018, at 7 pm, in the BHS Auditorium - BHS Guidance Department with Lenny Libenzon, BHS College Counselor, will go over the Junior Year Calendar, and Drew Heilpern from Summit Educational Group will talk about the different types of standardized tests that our juniors take (SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT, AP). This night is open to junior and sophomore students and their parents/caregivers. Please note that BHS does not specifically promote any outside testing prep companies, but appreciates their information sharing for this event.  
Special presentation before this event on December 11, 2018 – Please come early…**_Why Students Need to Rethink Social Media in 2018!_** _Today, both colleges and employers are actively looking at students' social media profiles.  Many employers are using third-party background screening companies as part of their hiring process. Legally, these companies can look at up to seven years of internet and social media history, which means **what students are posting today** may be part of a social media audit that could affect their prospective employment opportunities. Join Robin Clebnik, Career Exploration Expert and founder of InternBoston, as she explains exactly what information prospective schools and employers are looking for, as well as how students can use social media to build an authentic, discoverable and informative digital presence. There’s time for a Q + A at the end of the talk and all participants will receive a digital copy of this presentation._  
  
**FRESHMEN**
