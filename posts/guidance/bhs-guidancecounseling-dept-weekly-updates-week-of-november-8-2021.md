Through engagement in mentored summer research projects, participation in an advanced scientific curriculum during the academic year, and year-round professional skills training, students will acquire scientific knowledge and technical skills, and increase their understanding of how to conduct biomedical research.  This initiative is funded through an R25 grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI CA221738).

**CURE Summer Only**  
The **C**ontinuing **U**mbrella of **R**esearch **E**xperiences (CURE) program introduces Massachusetts high school and college students from underrepresented populations to the world of cancer research by placing them in real research settings at local cancer research institutions. Our goal is to encourage students to pursue future careers in the biosciences—particularly cancer research—giving practical meaning to academic course work and to expand and extend their interest in basic, clinical and/or population science research. At the same time, students make a valuable contribution to the DF/HCC research mission. By participating in a program at DF/HCC—an NCI comprehensive cancer center with more than 1100 researchers across seven Harvard institutions—students will learn from experts who are devoted to preventing, treating and curing cancer.

**Registration for the 2022 AP exams-** **This is the last week to register for AP Exams****. See below and check the BHS website for all registration information.**.   
**Students at Brookline High School will be registering online.** **Online Exam registration began on Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM and ends on Mon, Nov 15, 2021 at 11:59 PM.** **Any student who signs up after this date, is charged a $40 late fee from the College Board.**  
**Many students are signing up on the College Board, but not signing up on Total Registration which is where they pay for the exams. STUDENTS MUST COMPLETE BOTH STEPS.**   
The AP exam registration process has two steps, but both can be completed in one sitting when the student and parent/guardian do this together. **Even if you do not plan to take the AP exam, you need to complete both steps to access the College Board’s AP resources**. Both steps must be completed in order to have AP exams ordered:  
**Step 1:** Begin the process by registering at [www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/tQCNCDkJ8ruXOqYVi5yt5q?domain=user.totalregistration.net). Here you will indicate both the AP courses you are taking this year and the exams you wish to take. You will receive your join codes and directions to complete the second required step. Any exam fees will be paid online so be sure to have a **debit card or credit card available before beginning registration**. Paying online is a great way to make sure that payment has been made while avoiding mailing payment.  
**Step 2:** Use the join codes provided at the completion of step one to enroll the student's AP courses and exams in the College Board's system.  
This year each AP exam costs $105.00. Brookline High School would like to support every student in an AP class to take their AP exams. Students requiring financial assistance should contact Alexia Thomas, [alexia\_thomas@psbma.org](mailto:alexia_thomas@psbma.org), to learn more. If a student decides not to take an exam they must cancel their exam by **November 15th, 2021** to get a full refund, students can get a partial refund if they cancel by **March 15th, 2021.**   
Here are the important dates for the registration process:  
· Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM - Registration Begins  
· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 at 11:59 PM - Registrations and payments after this date will incur a $40 late fee per exam.  
· Mon, Nov 8, 2021 at 11:59 PM - Registration Ends  
· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 - Registrations that have not been paid for will be cancelled and exams will not be ordered.  
· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 - Last day to cancel an exam and receive a full refund.  
Please contact Alexia Thomas, [alexia\_thomas@psbma.org](mailto:alexia_thomas@psbma.org) , if you would like to register for an exam not listed or have any questions.  -- Alexia Thomas and Kate Kennedy, AP Exam Coordinators

**Introducing ….Thrive Scholars -** **This flagship college application support program admits students during their junior year of high school who meet the qualifications listed below.**  
If admitted through their application process, this program supports admitted juniors as they apply to college and prepares them to pursue their career goals. Thrive Scholars offers a two-stage application process.  The Thrive Scholars application process includes several essay questions as well as academic and financial documents that you need to prepare. Please make sure you give yourself enough time to complete it.  
   
Thrive Scholars reviews applications holistically and does not have absolute requirements for admission. However, students who are accepted into the program typically meet the following criteria: currently enrolled as a junior in high school, have SAT or PSAT score of 1200+ / ACT or Pre-ACT score of 25+ (\*if available- In response to the global pandemic and its continuing impact on student access to standardized tests, Thrive Scholars is reviewing applications with a test-optional policy. Since many students will not have test scores to report, we will focus more on a student’s grades and academic rigor within the context of what their school offers _(AP, IB, Dual Enrollment, etc.),_ identify as one of the following- a first-generation college student and/or a student of color.

**SOPHOMORES**  
   
**Thrive Scholars** **is a program that equips high-achieving, underrepresented scholars to thrive at top colleges and meaningful careers.** Their On-Ramp Program focuses on male African American students in their sophomore year of high school. Only 50 students nationally will be included in this new initiative with this organization. Are you a 10th grader POC who identifies as male?

**9TH GRADERS**   
  
  
The 9th grade counseling team continues to host a **Social Lunch for 9****th** **grade students who might benefit from having a quieter place to eat lunch**, especially our students who have had a more difficult time finding social connections during lunch! Students should come by the OLS Main Office during any Wednesday lunch period. Thanks to the counselor team for offering this important opportunity!
