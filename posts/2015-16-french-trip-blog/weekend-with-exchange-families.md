Saturday: Most of our exchange students took us out shopping in downtown Angers or in the main shopping mall, Atoll. Most shopping areas here have some stores that are also found in the US, but with different merchandise  Three students' correspondants had basketball games so they attended their matches. By the end of the day, the French students had organized a ''petite soirée'' for us, with dancing and all.   
  
  
Sunday: We took a rest day from the busy week we had. It was a sunny day so most of it was spent outside. Also most people went out to eat with their families for lunch or dinner. In France, eating out is lengthy. Each course is brought out separately and is appreciated with time. A lot of time is left between courses to properly digest and socialize. There was also a comic book convention that a few students attended with their families. Also, Kerimal went ice skating. We are having a great time.
