[BHS Guidance/Counseling Dept Weekly Updates – Week of Sept 20, 2021](//bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance/bhs-guidancecounseling-dept-weekly-updates-week-of-sept-20-2021)

			
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		9/19/2021
	

The final day of the two week schedule freeze is tomorrow, Monday 9/20.  If a student still desires a “change of mind”/ change of curriculum level schedule change, the student should be talking with their parent-guardian and current teacher about a possible change, then contacting their assigned counselor for an add/drop form.  We can not assure that all schedule changes requested can be made due to limited seats in classes and other challenges that may be part of a request. Curriculum Coordinators and Deans are also part of this process and their signatures will be needed on this form. Students need to continue attending all the classes in their current schedule until the add/form is completed and returned to the counselor for an actual schedule change.  
  
If a student has questions/concerns/or just wants to say hello to their counselor, please encourage your student to stop by their counselor’s office when not in class. Please note that counselors are continuing to work through needed schedule corrections and may be slow to respond for the next few days. Advise your student to leave a note or send an email to their counselor if they are not available. We’re here and ready to support EVERY BHS student!  

  
  
FAMILIES  
  
Mutual Aid Brookline is a group of community members who have been coordinating food deliveries and donations for groceries, medication, and other critical assistance since the start of the pandemic. 

*   Thanks to special, one-time funding from the Brookline Community Foundation, MAB will be giving out a limited number of money drops of $300 per household on a first-come, first-serve basis to Brookline community members who complete an online form or call our hotline at preset times.  We’re not a charity, we just want to take this rare opportunity to distribute some funds to our neighbors, to use however you want! (As a note, if you need food, our delivery program already covers that separately, so get in touch! We’re hoping this money can help with other needs.)  We will have several opportunities for you to get in on the drops:

*   Drop 3 sign-up opens at 8pm on Monday, September 27th for up to 15 households
*   Drop 4 sign-up opens at 12pm (noon) on Tuesday, October 5th for up to 15 households  

Please read the full FAQ here, so you will be ready to sign up: [shorturl.at/bmxzT](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/H-33CYEl5xCmvRYAu3nFsJ?domain=shorturl.at). A PDF version is also attached below.  You will find the link to sign up for a money drop in that FAQ, but it will only work at the times above. Check the FAQ at those times to sign up! If you prefer calling, you can also call our hotline at (617) 651-1468 during drop times to ask our volunteers to sign you up.  If you or a friend in Brookline want a money drop but need translation help, the sign-up form will be translated, and we will also have translators available to help on the phone at specific times (listed in the FAQs above).  Please let us know if you have questions, by replying to mutualaidbrookline@gmail.com or calling our hotline at (617) 651-1468. Our hotline is currently voicemail-only, so leave a message and we’ll get back to you!

Community Service Opportunities for BHS Students:  
Help Deliver Tablets and Troubleshoot Technology -- Tech Buddies Program  
During the height of the pandemic, many low-income Brookline elder residents were left extremely isolated.  Once the Brookline Public Library and BHA community rooms closed, residents relying on shared technology assets were left with no online resources. The new Tech Buddies program provides a tablet and 12 months of free internet access to low-income elders or adults with a disability living alone.  We will also provide technology education as well as tech support for our participants.  We are in desperate need of volunteers to help us make the Tech Buddies program a success and we are actively recruiting volunteers for the following roles: tablet delivery/set-up/basic education (in-person) or become part of our Tech Squad (remote). Please email Sophie Gordon at sgordon@brooklinema.gov with your interest or questions. CORI background check required.  
   
Student Directors of the Brookline Tutor Mentor Program (BTMP) are looking for tutors. The BTMP was founded in 2014 with the goal of connecting high-schoolers and middle schoolers both through academics and a supportive mentor system. We individually pair middle school students and high-achieving high school tutors based on students’ academic needs and interests. We aim to offer a tutor and a role model for kids who are struggling academically, need an extra challenge, or just want a friend. The Brookline Tutor Mentor Program is looking to recruit high schoolers to tutor and guide middle school kids. Being a tutor-mentor is one of the most fulfilling positions in the community. Not only will you receive community service hours and a good addition to your resume, but as a high school student, tutoring gives you an opportunity to truly engage with and support a middle school student. Whether they are struggling with school or need advice from a friendly face, the tutor-mentor program is their rock that can be relied on at any time. As role models, our job is to motivate young students and aid them in growing into mature young adults. Students and their mentors often create deep bonds that transcend age differences and continue even beyond the Tutor-Mentor Program.  
Please note: This year, the BTMP schedule is completely remote for the time being due to COVID-19. Because of this, tutoring hours are flexible! Tutors will be offered a large selection of times to meet with their students. If you apply, please regularly check your email for updates on meeting times, etc. If you are interested in giving back, earning community service hours, and adding something meaningful and unique to your resume, apply at [https://bit.ly/BTMPTutorApplication](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/a0uyCPN5QlI9YjV2Iz_0yz?domain=bit.ly). Please email btm@brooklineteencenter.org if you have any questions!

ChISL is an after school program for greater Boston high schoolers who are recent Chinese immigrants to build confidence in speaking English, make friends, and become more involved in the Chinatown community. Currently I am recruiting 9th and 10th graders for the program. See the attached flyer.  
   
   
9TH GRADERS  
   
Auditions for the 9th Grade Play, Almost Treasure Island, will take place on Sept 20th. The 9th Grade Play is a wonderful opportunity for new students to meet each other, cultivate an interest in theater, develop friendships and become part of a great community in the BHS Drama Society. No experience or preparation necessary! See complete information about auditions and helping with set/costumes/props etc at [www.brooklinefopa.org](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/2n2oCo26yKu5OBGQuYIAiR?domain=brooklinefopa.org) or email elena\_maimonis@psbma.org with any questions.
