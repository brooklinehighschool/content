**YES for CURE**  
The Young Empowered Scientists for ContinUed Research Engagement (YES for CURE) Program is a _three-year_ training initiative for highly motivated high school and undergraduate students interested in pursuing a career in scientific research. Through engagement in mentored summer research projects, participation in an advanced scientific curriculum during the academic year, and year-round professional skills training, students will acquire scientific knowledge and technical skills, and increase their understanding of how to conduct biomedical research.  This initiative is funded through an R25 grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI CA221738).  
  
**Application deadline November 22nd  
**To apply and check eligibility visit https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/research/cancer-disparities/students/yes-for-cure/  
  
**CURE Summer Only**  
The Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences (CURE) program introduces Massachusetts high school and college students from underrepresented populations to the world of cancer research by placing them in real research settings at local cancer research institutions. Our goal is to encourage students to pursue future careers in the biosciences—particularly cancer research—giving practical meaning to academic course work and to expand and extend their interest in basic, clinical and/or population science research. At the same time, students make a valuable contribution to the DF/HCC research mission. By participating in a program at DF/HCC—an NCI comprehensive cancer center with more than 1100 researchers across seven Harvard institutions—students will learn from experts who are devoted to preventing, treating and curing cancer.  
  
**Application Deadline February 4th**
