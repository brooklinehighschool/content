More details available on the BHS homepage and the BHS Guidance website noted above.  
The Brookline High Scholarship Committee would like parents to know that we use three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, unmet financial need. There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.   
Specific applications are now available for tuition scholarships to Boston University (2 full-tuition renewable scholarships) and Northeastern University (2 half-tuition renewable scholarships). Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2019 BHS Scholarship Application. Applications must be completed ASAP.   
The deadline for applying for all BHS scholarships for students attending ANY OTHER college is April 1. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code #0424. Please use the same application as above.
