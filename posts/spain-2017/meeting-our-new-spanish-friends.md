Salamanca is amazing! Yesterday we went to a local school to practice our speaking with people our age. At first the students were timid speaking to us, but after a few minutes they were eager to tell us all about all the things that Salamanca has to offer, we even went as far as exchanging numbers. They also enjoyed Kris´ demonstration of human car sounds and followed up by showing us their freestyle rapping and beat boxing.
