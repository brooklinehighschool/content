Student Council has been working tirelessly since April Break on bills ensuring a fair education for everyone, regardless of mental health or illness. We also just recently passed the Right to Rest bill, which states that students are entitled to five minute breaks in periods over sixty minutes, however due to Massachusetts regulations on school hours, this policy cannot go into effect. Legislature has also passed the Feedback Bill, which gives students the right to receive feedback for large exams/projects before the next assessment of the same type.  Here is the bill in full:  
Section I: A student may not be administered an assessment before they have received feedback for their last assessment (of the same type or content) in that class.   
Section II: When the student receives their score, they must be able to know which parts had points deducted (unless it’s an AP course). If a student takes their assessment late, both sections do not apply to them.  
Lastly, for the first time at BHS, elections for legislature will be held in the spring, so make sure to cast your vote! As always if you would like to propose a bill or an issue to your representative, that’s what we’re here for. It’s the perfect time to get involved from just talking with the legislature and student council to joining!
