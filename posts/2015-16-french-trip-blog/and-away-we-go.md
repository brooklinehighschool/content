​We have left Paris and what a great 48 hours it has been. Driving into the northern countryside of France was a beautiful ride seeing how the crowded streets of Paris quickly turned into lush green fields used by dairy farm cows. It was a different pace in Bayeau where we heard the story of William the Conqueror from 1066 while looking at the longest tapestry in France. Then, it was off to our hostel in Cherbourg where we ended our Friday adventures.  
  
Early on Saturday, we went deeper into the villages up north to explore the complicated unfolding of the military plans regarding D-Day. Here we all had a review of what events led to the outbreak of the war and why this battle on the beaches needed to occur. We had an amazing narrated tour after our visit to the first museum in Cain while riding to the American cemetery, and then the group took a trip to one last beach. That location showed us the remains of a "floating road" and some remnants of the temporary docks created by the Allies in order to resupply the troops for several months after June 6, 1944. When your kids come back, ask them about how the code names for each of the beaches were chosen, about the use of "clickers," and/or the nemesis of mobility, the hedges. I'm sure they can fill you in on some of those details.   
  
Sunday is a day for visiting some wonderful castles and then finally meeting up with our host families that evening.

I want to do more research on things I should see in France when I go and your blog is giving me really great ideas. Thank you so much!

							It sounds amazing to go to the beaches where D-Day happened. How deep was the cemetery in land and were there any bunkers still on the beach. I wonder if you guys went on Gold, Juno, Utah, Omaha, or sword beach.
