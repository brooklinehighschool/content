The 2nd Annual BHS Jobs/ Career Fair was a smashing success this past sunny Thursday 4/25! Over 35 vendor participants advised over 300 students on various career fields and possible job opportunities. Everyone who participated left with more information, some delicious snacks, and hopefully ideas to consider as they think about their futures. Students can always find BHS Career Counselor Kate Cordner (Office 280 or College – Career Center 279) or their assigned school counselor for more information.  
   
Another engaging opportunity for BHS students was offered on Tues 4/23 – Day of Mental Health Awareness. Many students joined workshops to build their understanding of mental health issues including the relationship between mental health and school, education around eating disorders, recognizing the impact of mental health in different communities, and overall understanding of and breaking down stigma of mental health concerns. Lastly, the important topic of how to support a friend or family member who you are worried about was emphasized. Important points were noted including finding at least one trusted adult in or out of school to talk to and the importance of letting an adult know if you have concerns about a friend. Never worry alone! See note on BHS Guidance website.
