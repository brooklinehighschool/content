Even though it is the only second day of school, we have been engulfed with jet lag, yawns, and getting lost, but we are surrounded by a completely different culture with so many different norms. It's fascinating to see how fast we have adjusted, or tried to adjust, to the time differences and the different eating schedules. I know I have eaten some amazing food, and between Salamanca and Madrid, I can't tell you which food I like the most. Being in the host family's home has been interesting; seeing the life of the family and the way they communicate with one another is a little weird (because I can understand only half of what they say), but super exciting. I have never felt confident in my speaking, and I have been able to advance and challenge myself, just in three days. I can't wait for the next week and a half!
