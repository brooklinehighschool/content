Go to <a href="https://www.teenlife.com/category/summer/" target="_blank">Teen Life Summer Programs</a> for a helpful info sheet for many ideas. Note that programs listed here are not all inclusive and do not suggest that Brookline High specifically endorses any program. Remember to read the intro at the top of the info sheet. See your counselor for more feedback or questions!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>SENIORS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>BHS&nbsp;General and&nbsp;BU, Northeastern Scholarship Info</strong>:<br>More details available on the BHS homepage and the BHS Guidance website noted above.<br>The Brookline High Scholarship Committee would like parents to know that we use three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, unmet financial need. There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.&nbsp; Specific applications are now available for tuition scholarships to Boston University (2 full-tuition renewable scholarships) and Northeastern University (2 half-tuition renewable scholarships). Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2019 BHS Scholarship Application. Applications must be completed ASAP.&nbsp;<br>​<br>The deadline for applying for all BHS scholarships for students attending ANY OTHER college is April 1.&nbsp;To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code #0424.&nbsp;Please use the same application as above.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>“Is it a Scam?” – Scholarship and other financial aid scams - Federal Trade Commission</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0082-scholarship-and-financial-aid-scams"><strong>http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0082-scholarship-and-financial-aid-scams</strong>&nbsp;</a><br>Beware of scholarship and other financial aid scams! This website can help you spot scams and avoid wasting your money.<br>&nbsp;<br>Seniors – If you haven’t already,&nbsp;<strong>please say thanks to your teachers and counselor who supported you by writing recommendations</strong>&nbsp;for your application process. Just saying stopping by to say thanks and let them know where you stand with admissions or writing a quick note make a BIG difference to those who helped you!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Early Decision acceptances - please contact all colleges also applied to EA/RD and remove your name from their lists...and congrats!</strong><br>As College Counselor Tara Anne Dowling suggests-&nbsp;“Say 'Thank you' as well as 'No, thank you'&nbsp;<br>--‘Thank you for taking time with my credentials’, ‘thank you for answering my questions’, ‘thank you for offering me a scholarship’ etc.<br>--‘No, thank you, I will be attending another college’ (you can say the name of your attending college if you feel comfortable)<br>This is done in myriad ways:<br>* via the online portal they may give you the option to decline your offer and say where you are going<br>* via email to the rep who has been working with you<br>* via post--did you get a big packet in the mail? There may be a postcard that asks for you to respond with info if you are declining the offer<br>&nbsp;<br>What is goodwill and why does it matter?<br>--Admission officers very often become invested in the students they are reviewing. They have read your file, recommended you to the admission committee, and perhaps put you up for a scholarship. Hard work deserves a big thank you.<br>--You never know if you may need to transfer<br>--You may have a younger sibling or friend who will attend this university. How can a good relationship that helps other people be a bad thing?<br><br>What's in it for me?<br>--If good will doesn't move you (or good manners!) then think of kids on waitlists who are dying to find out if they can have that place that is currently being held by you. You can help colleges clean up their records and make room for other candidates!"<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>READ YOUR EMAIL IF YOU HAVE APPLIED TO COLLEGE!&nbsp;</strong><strong>Set up and check your portal for each college. If you have questions, students should be contacting the admissions offices, not parents….. See this article for more info about documents to college -&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2018/11/21/parents-before-you-yell-at-your-childs-school-counselor/"><strong>http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2018/11/21/parents-before-you-yell-at-your-childs-school-counselor/</strong></a><br>&nbsp;<br>If you&nbsp;<strong>change your admissions requests or decide not to apply to a college on your original transcript release form</strong>,&nbsp;PLEASE NOTIFY YOUR COUNSELOR OR STOP BY ROOM 161 (Main Guidance Office) so we can update your requests.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Upcoming College Application Deadlines (Feb 1, Feb 15, March)</strong>&nbsp;- Remember that you are responsible to get all needed documents to your counselor, teacher, and the BHS Guidance office 4 weeks before your college deadline. Needed documents include: completed transcript request form, student self-questionnaire, parent brag sheet, list of colleges to any teacher who has agreed to write your recommendations. See your counselor if you have any questions.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college?</strong>&nbsp;You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please see Kate Cordner, the BHS Career Counselor, on Tues- Friday in Room 279 or 280 for more info.&nbsp;<br>*******************************************************************&nbsp;<br><strong><u>JUNIORS AND SENIORS&nbsp;</u></strong><br><strong>GAP YEAR INFO - BHS Counseling Dept/ USA Gap Year Fair&nbsp;1/14/19 event update – </strong>The taping of the “What is a Gap Year?” presentation did not come together.
