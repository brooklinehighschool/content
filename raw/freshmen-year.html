  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br><br><strong>Ninth grade (freshman) seminars</strong> focus on orientating students to the school's policies and expectations.&nbsp; Graduation requirements are reviewed and students are oriented on their Naviance accounts.&nbsp; The process of self exploration begins as students are asked to complete the "Learning Style" survey on Naviance and they are asked to fill out the "Personal Assessment Questionnaire".&nbsp; Good study habits are reviewed and the role of the guidance counselor is explained.&nbsp; Part of the Seminar expectation is that students will schedule one face to face meeting with their counselor using Naviance and email.&nbsp; Seminar meetings in the ninth grade are held during the advisory period beginning in late October.<br><br><br></div>
