**Summer PreCollege Program Info Fair - 1/25 - Mt Ida / UMass Amherst campus, Newton, 1-3pm**   
  
**Bill of Rights Institute sponsors the** **2019-2020 We the Students Essay Prompt - What does civil discourse mean to you?**  
Civil discourse is a concept that goes beyond a simple dictionary definition, and understanding it involves a combination of personal experience and ‘big ideas.’ Perhaps it is something you recognize from an occurrence in your own life. Maybe you can easily recognize when it is missing. Differing perspectives are a key part of learning, of democracies, and of civil society. For this essay, we ask you not only share your comprehension of what civil discourse is meant to be but to also relate what it looks like when it works – and when it doesn’t – and why. Perhaps you will choose to include mention of a time when you, yourself, were part of an exchange intended to understand something – how did you go about it? We encourage you to bring emotion, creativity, specific examples (including current events), and well-researched facts into what you write. A good essay will demonstrate how civil discourse is not just an abstract idea, but is, in fact, action inspired by constitutional principles, and demonstrated through civic virtues. We want to know what you think civil discourse truly means.  
The winners of this year’s contest will receive:  
1st Place – $7,500 and a scholarship to our 2020 Constitutional Academy in Washington, D.C.Runners Up – 5 prizes at $1,500 eachHonorable Mentions – 8 prizes at $500 each[https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/&sa=D&ust=1579225303304000&usg=AOvVaw1GrnQJjZUt5CPBwHWSURZR)

**SENIORS**  
**The Brookline High School Scholarship Committee announces that applications are now available for tuition scholarships to Boston University (2 full-tuition renewable scholarships) and Northeastern** **IMPORTANT UPDATE FOR LUNCH LOUNGE IS NOW ON WEDNESDAYS! PIZZA PARTY COMING on** **Wednesday** **January 22nd**! OLS Lunch Lounge takes place in the **Fireplace Room inside Home Base Room 107.** 9th graders should bring their own lunch on the 15th and on subsequent Wednesdays after the Pizza Party on 1/22.  
   
**The Brookline High School Scholarship Committee announces that applications are now available for tuition scholarships to Boston University (2 full-tuition renewable scholarships) and Northeastern University (2 half-tuition renewable scholarships).**  Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2020 BHS Scholarship Application.  Applications must be completed ASAP.   
The deadline for applying for BHS scholarships for students attending ANY OTHER college is April 1. Please use the same application as above.  The Scholarship Committee would like parents to know that we use three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, **unmet financial need**.  There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.  To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code  #0424  
   
**Deferred to regular decision?** Please carefully read advice from the BHS Counseling/Guidance Department about next steps – attached  
   
Seniors – If you haven’t already, **please say thanks to your teachers and counselor who supported you by writing recommendations** for your application process. Just stopping by to say thanks and let them know where you stand with admissions or writing a quick note makes a BIG difference to those who helped you!  
   
**Early Decision acceptances - please contact all colleges also applied to for EA/RD and remove your name from their lists...and congrats!**  
  
As College Counselor Tara Anne Dowling suggests-  
“Say 'Thank you' as well as 'No, thank you'   
\--‘Thank you for taking time with my credentials’, ‘thank you for answering my questions’, ‘thank you for offering me a scholarship’ etc.  
\--‘No, thank you, I will be attending another college’ (you can say the name of your attending college if you feel comfortable)  
This is done in myriad ways:  
\* via the online portal they may give you the option to decline your offer and say where you are going  
\* via email to the rep who has been working with you  
\* via post--did you get a big packet in the mail? There may be a postcard that asks for you to respond with info if you are declining the offer  
What is goodwill and why does it matter?  
\--Admission officers very often become invested in the students they are reviewing. They have read your file, recommended you to the admission committee, and perhaps put you up for a scholarship. Hard work deserves a big thank you.  
\--You never know if you may need to transfer  
\--You may have a younger sibling or friend who will attend this university. How can a good relationship that helps other people be a bad thing?  
What's in it for me?  
\--If good will doesn't move you (or good manners!) then think of kids on waitlists who are dying to find out if they can have that place that is currently being held by you. You can help colleges clean up their records and make room for other candidates!"

**READ YOUR EMAIL IF YOU HAVE APPLIED TO COLLEGE! Set up and check your portal for each college. If you have questions, students (not parents) should be contacting the admissions offices!**   
Although over 77% of the BHS Class of 2020 has applied to college as of 1/1/20, there are still seniors working on their post- high school plan. There are many 4 year colleges still accepting applications, so see your counselor or Mr Libenzon, BHS College Counselor, for support.  
   
Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college? You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please see Kate Cordner Kennedy, the BHS Career Counselor in Room 279 or 280 for more info.  If she is not available when you stop by (since she is also working with 9th graders at the OLS campus), please leave her a note!
