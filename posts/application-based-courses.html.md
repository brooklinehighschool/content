**Racial Awareness Seminar**:​  10th grade, social studies elective or BHS elective credit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a yearlong, co-taught Social Studies elective course that explores the complexities of race within our national, local and high school communities. Students will meet in a seminar-style class designed to foster students’ capacity to reflect on and speak effectively about their own identities and to listen carefully and thoughtfully as others reflect on and speak about theirs. The class, therefore, will require students to articulate their own experiences, to learn from their classmates' experiences, and to develop a greater understanding across racial identification lines. Students will engage in experiential learning activities and group discussions and will read and view materials provided by the teachers. Each quarter, students will attend two school or community events that will enhance their racial understanding. They will also be challenged to think of ways to share their new understandings with the greater.  For more information, [contact Ms. Wells](mailto:hayley_wells@psbma.org).  [Download a HARD COPY OF THE APPLICATION here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpM-c0sRXx1bcAI0Z09g6w2VHVLgI_KVo2RdB0Fsh7Q/edit) or find one on outside the door of room 303 at OLS.  **DUE:  Wednesday, February 26.**
