Our Program
-----------

2021-2022 will be our seventh season excluding last year’s missed  
season due to the pandemic. After losing many 4-year veterans to  
graduation in 2020, this year will be a rebuilding year. We continue to  
schedule match play with mostly private schools in the Boston area as  
well the few other public schools that support squash teams.  
  
Tryouts and Practices: We hold an informational meeting during X-Block, Thur Oct. 28th in Room 211 (Science Wing). Come all!. Tryouts are held after the  
Thanksgiving break to make up the 15-player boys and 15-player girls  
teams. We use the five courts at the Winsor School from 6:00-8:45pm  
M-F throughout the season. Boys' and girls' squads’ practices rotate  
between 6-7:20, then 7:30-8:45 timeslots. Challenge matches  
throughout the season determine the ladder that fields our 7-person  
varsity and 7-person JV teams.  
  
Matches:  We schedule home matches at 6:00pm at the Winsor School, 103  
Pilgrim Way, The Fenway. Buses or vans bring players to away matches. Our  
season-culminating tournament is High School Nationals sponsored by US Squash,  
this season to be held at the new Arlen Specter Squash Center, Philadelphia PA  
Feb 25-27, 2022. We also hold a local Boston Area Public School Championship  
tournament including BHS, Needham HS, Concord-Carlisle RHS, and  
Squashbusters-Boston at the Northeastern University courts.  
  
Resources and Venues:  British squash pro Nick Matthew has a brief (two minute)    
video that explains the rules of squash, www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gQsAKZ71tU  
Please check this out if you’re new to the game or want a refresher as a returning  
player. Mass. Squash and US Squash are invaluable for providing players of all  
levels with coaching tips, match play, and clinics.  
  
In addition to our home courts at the Winsor School, local venues that players can  
access include the Harvard Murr Center, 65 North Harvard St., Allston (#66 bus  
from Brookline), the BU FitRec Center’s five courts next to the Agganis Arena on  
Comm. Ave, Dover Squash Academy, Rt. 9 Natick, Cross Courts, 19 Tech Circle,  
Natick, and a number of private clubs in town including the University Club,  
Harvard Club, Tennis & Racquet Club, and the Union Boat Club.
