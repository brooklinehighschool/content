                  <div class="paragraph">Welcome to the 2021-22 school year!&nbsp;<br><br>The two week schedule freeze is now in place until Monday 9/20.&nbsp; Students need to continue attending all the classes in their current schedule UNLESS A COURSE IS MISSING OR WAS NOT REQUESTED (IN MARCH 2020). If a student still desires a “change of mind”/ change of curriculum level schedule change by 9/20, the student should be talking with their parent-guardian and current teacher about a possible change, then contacting their assigned counselor to see if a change is possible when working with curriculum coordinators and deans. We can not assure that all schedule changes requested after 9/20 can be made due to limited seats in classes and other challenges that may be part of a request.<br>&nbsp;<br>If a student has questions/concerns/or just wants to say hello to their counselor, please encourage your student to stop by their counselor’s office when not in class. Please note that counselors are continuing to work through needed schedule corrections and may be slow to respond for the next few days. Advise your student to leave a note or send an email to their counselor if they are not available. We’re here and ready to support EVERY BHS student!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

The BTMP was founded in 2014 with the goal of connecting high-schoolers and middle schoolers both through academics and a supportive mentor system. We individually pair middle school students and high-achieving high school tutors based on students’ academic needs and interests. We aim to offer a tutor and a role model for kids who are struggling academically, need an extra challenge, or just want a friend. The Brookline Tutor Mentor Program is looking to recruit high schoolers to tutor and guide middle school kids. Being a tutor-mentor is one of the most fulfilling positions in the community. Not only will you receive community service hours and a good addition to your resume, but as a high school student, tutoring gives you an opportunity to truly engage with and support a middle school student. Whether they are struggling with school or need advice from a friendly face, the tutor-mentor program is their rock that can be relied on at any time. As role models, our job is to motivate young students and aid them in growing into mature young adults. Students and their mentors often create deep bonds that transcend age differences and continue even beyond the Tutor-Mentor Program.<br>Please note: This year, the BTMP schedule is completely remote for the time being due to COVID-19. Because of this, tutoring hours are flexible! Tutors will be offered a large selection of times to meet with their students. If you apply, please regularly check your email for updates on meeting times, etc. If you are interested in giving back, earning community service hours, and adding something meaningful and unique to your resume, apply at <a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/a0uyCPN5QlI9YjV2Iz_0yz?domain=bit.ly">https://bit.ly/BTMPTutorApplication</a>.
