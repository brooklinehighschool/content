		11/8/2020
	

**Important reminders for this week of November 9:**  
**ALL GR 10-12 STUDENTS SHOULD CHECK THEIR UPDATE SCHEDULE ON THE STUDENT/PARENT PORTALS FOR NEW CLASSROOM LOCATIONS FOR STUDENTS STARTING HYBRID SCHOOL THIS WEEK!**

*   **NEW Weekly Hybrid schedule to accommodate safe inside lunches for all students in the OLS and the 115 buildings starts this week**  -See Head of School Meyer’s Saturday email and see attached schedules here for both OLS and 115
*   **Hybrid schooling has started for 9th graders at OLS for the past 2 weeks.** It continues to be a pleasure  with some challenges as many 9th graders attend in-person classes at the OLS building. Cohorted travel will start for in-person 9th graders on Monday so they will also be experiencing the travel between OLS and the 115/ Unified Arts Buildings starting Monday 11/9 too. The increased engagement with teachers and curriculum for elective and wellness classes should be helpful for many students.
*    **Hybrid schooling for students in Grades 10-12 will start this Monday November 9. BHS faculty and staff are excited and anxious about this shift…** Staff is looking forward to seeing many students in-person for the first time this year. All students and families should be patient as we enter into yet another positive and new stage of teaching/learning/supporting this school year!
*   **ALL BHS STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE REMOTE WEDNESDAYS** as we move forward. **NO SCHOOL THIS WEDNESDAY Nov 11 for Veteran’s Day holiday.** 
*   **Quarter 1 ended this past Friday, November 6.** The school year moves along fast! Student report cards will be posted on the student/parent portals on Thursday Nov 19. Keep up the good work for students who started this year strong! For those who had some challenges… it’s a new quarter. Make some constructive changes, reach out for extra help, you can do this!

  

*   **Wondering how to support BHS educators who are feeling lots of “feels” these days all at the same time** \- excited, nervous, overwhelmed, energized, tired, upbeat, unsure? [Grown and Flown suggests 12 Ways Parents Can Support Their Teen’s Teachers](https://grownandflown.com/how-parents-can-support-teachers/?utm_source=Grown+%26+Flown+Email+Subscription&utm_campaign=fd9c472e65-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_07_01_34&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fc15798a65-fd9c472e65-246876214) (and other educators) in these times - **Try this one:**  **Write a note letting an \[educator\] know specifically how s/he has helped your student** - an encouraging note or email from a parent can go a long way toward making a teacher/counselor/dean/educator feel appreciated. Knowing that s/he has made an impact on a child’s life–academically or personally–and that parents have noticed that impact, can give an \[educator\] the boost s/he needs to face the next challenge. 

    
**BHS counselors at both the OLS and 115 Greenough buildings will be present both in person and remotely as we move to a hybrid school plan**. Students will be offered a safe space in the 285 guidance suite and near the 9th grade counselor offices at OLS to set up zoom meetings with counselors and social workers who may be remote on certain days. These spaces will be available for students while in-person who need a confidential space to remotely talk with a counselor or social worker.   
Students should contact their counselor directly for more information on how to set up these counseling zoom meetings while in-person at school. Various posters will be shared and posted this week with instructions about how to  make appointments and also with QR scan codes that students can use from their phone to automatically connect with their counselor’s or social worker’s phone, email, or zoom office hours space.  
   
Reminder - All NEW UPDATES will be highlighted in BLUE each week for easy scanning of newest info.  
   
**ALL STUDENTS**  
   
**From the Nurses: As a reminder, a new state mandate requires that all students get a flu vaccine by December 31, 2020.** **Any questions should be directed to the BHS nurses’ clinics at OLS -** [**April\_Armstrong@psbma.org**](mailto:April_Armstrong@psbma.org)  
**and** [**Jill\_Seaman-Chandler@psbma.org**](mailto:Jill_Seaman-Chandler@psbma.org) **/** [**Megan\_Day@psbma.org**](mailto:Megan_Day@psbma.org) **/ Kate\_Donnelly@psbma.org**   
   
**COVID testing site in Brookline now open and will provide tests for town residents, Public Schools of Brookline students and staff, as well as town employees, and family members of staff and students.**  
PCR swab tests will be available on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Wednesdays and Fridays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Appointments can be made by booking online [here](https://mpathy.org/schedule). Walk-ins are also available. The testing program will run now until Dec. 31.  
Testing will be conducted outdoors in tents in the Health Department parking lot at [11 Pierce Street](https://goo.gl/maps/1eBm5fPiRzg7NfSE9), while weather permits. Testing will then be moved inside to the Denny Room, located on the lower level of the Brookline Department of Public Health Building, accessed through the Harvard Street entrance.  
   
Testing is available for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, however, only the costs for those displaying symptoms will be processed through the patients’ health insurance provider. Asymptomatic and uninsured individuals will be required to pay $140. Asymptomatic individuals who seek testing may request reimbursement for the expense through their insurance company.  
We are hopeful that this testing site will provide a convenience for parents, students, and staff to undergo timely testing when symptoms develop, to identify positive cases quickly, as well as to allow for a quick return to school when tests are negative and symptoms have resolved.   
   
To facilitate contact tracing within the schools, staff or students who live outside of Brookline must sign a consent form allowing the test results to be sent directly to the Department of Brookline Public Health, in addition to the health department of the individual’s home residence.  
   
School nurses will continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Brookline Public Health to identify close contacts of positive cases within the school setting.  An individual’s local board of health will continue to manage the positive cases of their community. This partnership allows for a quicker review of close contacts within the school system and determination of school attendance.

**First Generation College Applicant now or in the next few years? Here’s a webinar you may find helpful from the College Guidance Network:**  
Students and families will hear from a panel of experts, all first-generation students themselves, for a candid discussion filled with practical tips and inspiring personal stories. Plus, get answers to questions related to financial aid, choosing a major, and fighting imposter syndrome.

**Wednesday, November 11 at 7:00 PM ET**  
   
**L Grade, Curriculum Level Changes and Class Drop Timelines:**  
For class drops (with end of term is Nov 6), then:  
    \* For changing of a class, 12/1 will be the deadline for curriculum level changes for full year classes. After that date, a special action form is needed and W on transcript.  
     \* For non full year courses, the deadline for a semester course will be extended to 11/3 (one week after the 2nd IPR of quarter 1). After that date, the course will be on the transcript with a W.  
   
L grade  (Late entry) - If a level change occurs within 10 class periods of the end of the marking period, the student will earn a grade of "L” in the new course for that marking period, as of 10/19.

*   **“L” Grade** – The “L” grade occurs if a student makes a course level change within the last ten class periods at the end of a marking period, they will receive an L on their transcript for that term grade in the NEW course.  The “L” stands for late entry. **This policy is particularly important for SENIORS to be aware of since the L grade may appear on transcripts sent to colleges for Term 1.**

    
High school students – Join Splash**,** an event where Brandeis Undergraduates teach interactive classes to our local youth. This learning extravaganza allows middle and high schoolers to learn and grow their interests about niche subjects. The best part is…._IT’S FREE_!  **Splash 2020 will be held virtually on Saturday, November 14th, 2020**. The SPLASH organizers know kids are struggling with zoom learning as are Brandeis students as well. They hope that this Splash event will be a good way to give students a break from the normal curriculum and help them explore new passions virtually!   
_Attached is a flyer of the event and a list of all the classes being taught this year._

**Mental health Supports:**  
   
_Expert Advisory Panel 2 on Support to Address the Whole Child Experience will post a tip each week to support caregivers during this time._  
**If possible, create a _calming space_ in your home where your child knows they can go when upset and in need of an activity that can calm them down.** Some ideas are drawing art (drawing their emotions), playing with something sensory and tactile like a squishy ball, looking at a sparkle jar or listening to calming music.  
(Visit the [reopening hub](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Y_DXCyPJX5u0vNM6uZzfgf?domain=sites.google.com) for all Panel 2 wellness tips and the [expert panel page](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/LVGACzpxX5cxlR28TXhJGW?domain=l.facebook.com) for a complete list of panel presentations and recommendations.)

**HandholdMA.org is a new online initiative from DMH/CBHI to provide comprehensive, accessible, multi-lingual mental health information for parents, caregivers, and families.** Parents-caregivers know their child better than anyone. You may still have a few questions. COVID-19 is putting incredible pressure on families. You might be noticing your child is struggling in new ways, or that old problems are getting worse.  
It answers common questions such as, 'Should I worry?' 'What can I do?' and 'Who can help?'

**Oct 14 BHS SAT test takers** \- The College Board has released scores for the 10/14 in-school SAT, starting this past Wednesday 11/4.  Scores should now be fully available on students' College Board accounts. Any student who doesn't have a CB account should set one up at [https://www.collegeboard.org/](https://www.collegeboard.org/).   
Students can call the College Board Student Help Line at 866-756-7346 and go to option "scores" if they have any further questions.  
   
**Thinking of changing sending an ACT or SAT test score after you’ve applied test optional?**   
BHS Counselors are advising students to call each school that they are applying to ask how to manage shifting from test optional to sending scores because there does not seem to be common practice in admissions offices.   
  
  
  
   
**SENIORS – READ YOUR EMAILS!**   
**ALSO BE SURE TO FOLLOW ANY APPLICANT PORTAL DIRECTIONS** for colleges you will be applying to, if they have a portal protocol. Your efficiency in opening up these accounts after applying is sometimes monitored by admissions offices to gauge your level of interest!  
   
**MEFA financial aid events** will all be online this fall.  BHS Guidance partners with the Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (MEFA) each year to provide families with a wealth of financial aid information. This year, due to the global pandemic, MEFA will not be sending their speakers out to high schools. Please visit [https://www.mefa.org/events](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/-O6zCo26yKuBRLQqi1dF7y?domain=mefa.org) to investigate upcoming webinars and take a look at their very informative website.   
   
**Seniors - Please review your unofficial transcript for any missing classes or errors. Contact your counselor with any questions or concerns.**  
It is your responsibility to be sure your transcript is accurate before giving BHS permission to send to any colleges or post HS grad programs.  
You should be **checking that you are earning all required credits towards graduation** this June 2021 too.  
English- 4 credits  
Science - 3 credits  
Social Studies/History - 3 credits including US History  
Math - 3 credits (4 years required for UMass State colleges/universities)  
World Language - 2 credits (same language)  
Elective - 3 credits distributed across Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Career/Tech, Community Service  
Wellness - .5 Lifetime Wellness, 3 - .25 wellness credits  
\+ additional credits to earn minimum total credits of 22  
We will not be sharing any GPA information with colleges on official transcripts. See your Naviance account for your current “working” BHS GPA.  
   
**College Application Reminders:**  
   
**Help the BHS counselors and teachers support your application process by meeting these deadlines.** Submit your electronic transcript release forms, your self-questionnaire, your parent/caregiver’s “brag” sheet, and give notice to your teachers who have agreed to write recommendations for you**.**  
**If you have college application deadlines for 11/15 and 12/1 and you have not yet completed a transcript release request, please do this step and contact your counselor immediately to confirm.** **Also connect with your teachers regarding recommendations since you are behind in informing these critical BHS staff people who want to do their best to support your college application process.**  
   
**College Deadline**                                                 **BHS Deadline**  
December 15                                                            Monday November 16  
January 1                                                                  Monday November 30   
(includes no school December break)  
January 15                                                                Wednesday December 9  
February 1                                                                 Wednesday January 6  
February 15                                                              Friday January 15  
   
Seniors – When submitting your transcript release forms electronically, please:

*   **use the updated link** shared by your counselor (on their CANVAS page or by email)
*   be sure to **list your college names and addresses CORRECTLY AS THEY APPEAR OFFICIALLY ON THE COLLEGE’S WEBSITE OR NAVIANCE**. The processing of your request is slowed down by not including the official name of the college or putting in wrong information.

    
**Virtual College Representative visits at BHS continue for a few more weeks**– Seniors can attend any and all college sessions of schools they plan to or are interested in attending. The schedule and REQUIRED zoom link registration can be found on your Naviance homepage. This is a wonderful way to learn more about colleges, ask important questions, and show demonstrated interest!  
   
**SENIORS AND JUNIORS**  
   
**Great quick read from Grown and Flown about college fit in the college search process** **\- written by Adam Weinberg, President of Denison University in Ohio (so there is some Denison specific encouragement). The article also does not cite virtual college search and visit expectations at this time due to the pandemic….but helpful for juniors/seniors and their parents-cargivers to consider** **\-** [**How to Help Teens Find a Good College Fit, From a University President**](https://grownandflown.com/college-fit-why-important/?utm_source=Grown+%26+Flown+Email+Subscription&utm_campaign=fd9c472e65-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_07_01_34&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fc15798a65-fd9c472e65-246876214)

**The excellent presenter, Julia Rogers of Enroute Consulting, also shared digital versions of some worksheets she referenced in her presentation and those sheets are attached to this email.**   
   
**AP Final notice for registration - If you do not plan to take any AP exams this year, please ignore this email.**   
The final ordering deadline for AP® Exams is just two weeks away—November 13, 2020.  Students can still order exams after this date, however it will cost an additional $40 late fee.  
Given the uncertainties of the 2020-21 school year, some students may feel unsure about taking AP Exams in May. So students feel comfortable registering by the fall deadline, there will be no fees if a student decides not to test or to cancel their exams. An additional $40 fee only applies to each exam ordered after this deadline.  
Please remember there are two steps in the AP exam registration process.  
#1. You must log into Total Registration to pay for the exam,  
· [www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/nVbhCR651nuR2jPETNPw_n?domain=user.totalregistration.net)  
#2. "Join the class" on the College Board website.  
Without doing both of these steps, we cannot order an exam for you.  If you have any questions about this process, please contact us via email.
