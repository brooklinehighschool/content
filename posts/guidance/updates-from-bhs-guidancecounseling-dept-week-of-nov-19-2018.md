**SENIORS**  
**VERY IMPORTANT…..If you are a senior applying EA or ED deadlines in Oct – Nov, YOU MUST LOOK AT YOUR UPLOADED FINAL GRADES FOR QUARTER 1 ON THE STUDENT PORTAL IMMEDIATELY.** If there are any missing grades, it is your responsibility to contact that teacher and your counselor to correct this issue. Senior counselors have reviewed  and the department will be sending out transcripts starting Monday 11/19 - Wed 11/21 at noon, including Q1 grades, to colleges of early applicants. Admissions offices will be considering this information as they review early applications and make decisions for mid- December.  
   
If you **change your admissions requests or decide not to apply to a college on your original transcript release form**, PLEASE NOTIFY YOUR COUNSELOR OR STOP BY ROOM 161 (Main Guidance Office) so we can update your requests.  
   
Last note for **EARLY DECISION applications** – remember you cannot apply to more than one ED school. This may also apply to Restricted Early Action applications as well. The Guidance Dept will be in touch with you when we note these errors. Let your counselor know if you are applying ED so they can sign off electronically on the ED form for these applications by deadlines. Thank you!

This night is open to junior and sophomore students and their parents/caregivers. Please note that BHS does not specifically promote any outside testing prep companies, but appreciates their information sharing for this event.  
Special presentation before this event on December 11, 2018 – Please come early…**_Why Students Need to Rethink Social Media in 2018!_**  
 _Today, both colleges and employers are actively looking at students' social media profiles.  Many employers are using third-party background screening companies as part of their hiring process. Legally, these companies can look at up to seven years of internet and social media history, which means **what students are posting today** may be part of a social media audit that could affect their prospective employment opportunities._   
_Join us on Tuesday, December 11, 2018 from 6:15 to 7pm to hear Robin Clebnik, Career Exploration Expert and founder of InternBoston, explain exactly what information prospective schools and employers are looking for, as well as how students can use social media to build an authentic, discoverable and informative digital presence. There’s time for a Q + A at the end of the talk and all participants will receive a digital copy of this presentation._
