[​BHS Guidance/Counseling Dept Weekly Updates – Week of Nov 2, 2020](//bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance/bhs-guidancecounseling-dept-weekly-updates-week-of-nov-2-2020)

			
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		11/1/2020
	

Important reminders for all as we enter into November:

*   Another special school schedule is happening this week of Nov 2. Students will not have school on Tues 11/3 due to a BHS Professional Development Day. The revised schedule is attached to this email.
*   Hybrid schooling has started for 9th graders at OLS this past week. It was fun to welcome many 9th graders into the OLS building and the classrooms and hallways!
*   Hybrid schooling for students in Grades 10-12 are targeted to start on November 9.
*   BHS STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE REMOTE WEDNESDAYS as of last week.
*   Quarter 1 IPR (interim progress report) #2 will be uploaded to both student and parent portals this Wednesday 10/28 ONLY FOR STUDENTS WHOSE GRADE IS BELOW A C+ or whose grade went down by one full grade since IPR #1. These IPRs offer an excellent opportunity for parents/caregivers to discuss the successes that a student is experiencing with school and provide a morale boost for classes that may not be going smoothly. Students can still improve academic work between now and the Quarter 1 end date of 11/6.
*   Quarter 1 ends on November 6

Counselors continue to work very closely with seniors right now for advising and counselor recommendation writing. **If any student issue is urgent, please indicate URGENT in the email heading. Counselors will be responding to all emails within 2-3 school days, but they will prioritize emails marked urgent.** Thanks for your understanding!  
   
 **ALL STUDENTS**  
   
Haven’t gotten your cohort assignment yet in Gr 10-12? Not all students have gotten their cohort assignment yet so please be patient as that planning continues through this week. Thank you!  
   
L Grade, Curriculum Level Changes and Class Drop Timelines:  
For class drops (with end of term is Nov 6), then:  
    \* For changing of classes, 12/1 will be the deadline for curriculum level changes for full year classes. After that date, a special action form is needed and W on transcript.  
     \* For non full year courses, the deadline for a semester course will be extended to 11/3 (one week after the 2nd IPR of quarter 1). After that date, the course will be on the transcript with a W.  
   
L grade  (Late entry) - If a level change occurs within 10 class periods of the end of the marking period, the student will earn a grade of "L” in the new course for that marking period, as of 10/19.

*   **“L” Grade** – The “L” grade occurs if a student makes a course level change within the last ten class periods at the end of a marking period, they will receive an L on their transcript for that term grade in the NEW course.  The “L” stands for late entry. **This policy is particularly important for SENIORS to be aware of since the L grade may appear on transcripts sent to colleges for Term 1.**

    
High school students – Join Splash**,** an event where Brandeis Undergraduates teach interactive classes to our local youth. This learning extravaganza allows middle and high schoolers to learn and grow their interests about niche subjects. The best part is…._IT’S FREE_!  **Splash 2020 will be held virtually on Saturday, November 14th, 2020**. The SPLASH organizers know kids are struggling with zoom learning as are Brandeis students as well. They hope that this Splash event will be a good way to give students a break from the normal curriculum and help them explore new passions virtually!   
_Attached is a flyer of the event and a list of all the classes being taught this year._  
To register as a student, click here: [https://brandeis.learningu.org/learn/register.html](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Vu4TCo26yKuB9p38S1OBWY?domain=brandeis.learningu.org)

**Mental health Supports:**  
   
**HandholdMA.org is a new online initiative from DMH/CBHI to provide comprehensive, accessible, multi-lingual mental health information for parents, caregivers, and families.** Parents-caregivers know their child better than anyone. You may still have a few questions. COVID-19 is putting incredible pressure on families. You might be noticing your child is struggling in new ways, or that old problems are getting worse.  
It answers common questions such as, 'Should I worry?' 'What can I do?' and 'Who can help?'   
Here's the link: [https://handholdma.org/](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/nWWFC68z9yc1BYVVup3UHa?domain=handholdma.org/)

We've created new Teen Stress Less Kits - complete with everything you need to take a break from screens, complete a relaxing project, and have fun. To learn more about these teen events, text @brklibteen to the number 81010.  
   
**Family Support Groups offered by BRYT Central**. This organization is restarting the online Family Support Groups they began last spring 2020. As they get up and running this fall, groups will happen three times a week and will remain open to all parents (not just parents of BRYT students). We are working on getting a Spanish language group up and running - stay tuned!  
Currently, the times are:

The leaders of the Brookline DoSomething Club lead campaigns on social issues. One of their campaigns is to gather a list of scholarships + resources for undocumented students. They wanted to spread the word about this resource so here is the link to the list: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13UXBGHR\_P\_vErimu0LiA5kJ1Ysp8EziwhU4r9EUjRmM/edit?usp=sharing](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/H-faCo26yKuBnXDjF15e-M?domain=docs.google.com)   
   
   
If you missed the **Senior Parent Coffee** Q&A last Thursday 10/22, below is the link for the recording:  
[https://psbma-org.zoom.us/rec/share/WHA5uFBFkGsmCCt1xq2fGinU-yFB8eQcO-6obu19gjl3GAaxDjVe6MQPjNRn\_Ofe.zOTh9LVbQlnZvu2E](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/JwVWC1wB4qCk0nGYiGt5ql?domain=psbma-org.zoom.us)   
Passcode: 8r7Mh8^9  
   
**Oct 14 BHS SAT test takers** \- Nov 4 is the score release date for the 10/14 in school SAT. Scores will be released on students' College Board accounts. Any student who doesn't have a CB account yet should set one up at [https://www.collegeboard.org/](https://www.collegeboard.org/).   
Students can call the College Board Student Help Line at 866-756-7346 and go to option "scores" if they have any further questions.  
   
**Thinking of changing sending an ACT or SAT test score after you’ve applied test optional?**   
BHS Counselors are advising students to call each school that they are applying to ask how to manage shifting from test optional to sending scores because there does not seem to be common practice in admissions offices.   
  
  
   
**SENIORS – READ YOUR EMAILS!**   
**ALSO BE SURE TO FOLLOW ANY APPLICANT PORTAL DIRECTIONS** for colleges you will be applying to, if they have a portal protocol.  
   
**MEFA financial aid events** will all be online this fall.  BHS Guidance partners with the Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (MEFA) each year to provide families with a wealth of financial aid information. This year, due to the global pandemic, MEFA will not be sending their speakers out to high schools. Please visit [https://www.mefa.org/events](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/-O6zCo26yKuBRLQqi1dF7y?domain=mefa.org) to investigate upcoming webinars and take a look at their very informative website.   
   
**Seniors - Please review your unofficial transcript for any missing classes or errors. Contact your counselor with any questions or concerns.**  
It is your responsibility to be sure your transcript is accurate before giving BHS permission to send to any colleges or post HS grad programs.  
You should be **checking that you are earning all required credits towards graduation** this June 2021 too.  
English- 4 credits  
Science - 3 credits  
Social Studies/History - 3 credits including US History  
Math - 3 credits (4 years required for UMass State colleges/universities)  
World Language - 2 credits (same language)  
Elective - 3 credits distributed across Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Career/Tech, Community Service  
Wellness - .5 Lifetime Wellness, 3 - .25 wellness credits  
\+ additional credits to earn minimum total credits of 22  
We will not be sharing any GPA information with colleges on official transcripts. See your Naviance account for your current “working” BHS GPA.  
  
  
  
   
**College Application Reminders:**  
   
**Help the BHS counselors and teachers support your application process by meeting these deadlines. S**ubmit your electronic transcript release forms, your self-questionnaire, your parent/caregiver’s “brag” sheet, and give notice to your teachers who have agreed to write recommendations for you**.**  
**If you have college application deadlines for 10/15, 11/1, 11/15, 12/1 and you have not yet completed a transcript release request, please do this step and contact your counselor immediately to confirm.** **Also connect with your teachers regarding recommendations since you are behind in informing these critical BHS staff people who want to do their best to support your college application process.**  
   
**College Deadline**                                                  **BHS Deadline**  
December 15                                                                        Monday November 16  
January 1                                                                   Monday November 30   
(includes no school December break)  
January 15                                                                 Wednesday December 9  
February 1                                                                 Wednesday January 6  
February 15                                                               Friday January 15  
   
Seniors – When submitting your transcript release forms electronically, please:

*   **use the updated link** shared by your counselor (on their CANVAS page or by email)
*   be sure to **list your college names and addresses CORRECTLY AS THEY APPEAR OFFICIALLY ON THE COLLEGE’S WEBSITE OR NAVIANCE**. The processing of your request is slowed down by not including the official name of the college or putting in wrong information.

    
**Virtual College Representative visits at BHS continue** – Seniors can attend any and all college sessions of schools they plan to or are interested in attending. The schedule and REQUIRED zoom link registration can be found on your Naviance homepage. This is a wonderful way to learn more about colleges, ask important questions, and show demonstrated interest!  
   
**SENIORS AND JUNIORS**  
   
**Interested in a Gap Year?**  Join the BHS Guidance/Counseling Dept this Thurs 11/5 at 6:30pm for **Taking a Gap Year: A Zoom Presentation for BHS Students & Parents – November 5, 6:30-8:15pm**  
Taking a gap year after high school is becoming an increasingly popular option for students, but how do you know if it's the right choice for you or your child? Join gap year expert Julia Rogers of EnRoute Consulting for a presentation that will cover the benefits, challenges and opportunities surrounding the gap year option in the era of COVID-19. She will guide attendees through the opportunities available in the age of corona - and how plans could evolve based on the global outlook. She will also discuss how to plan for college deferment or reapplication, how to finance gap time and provide tips for designing a meaningful gap year.   Please register at this link to join this presentation -  
[**Registration link**](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/zHkoClYM7LuAnyA8UGVerd?domain=us02web.zoom.us)  
   
**Students Taking an AP Course**\-    
If you are not taking an AP course this year and don't plan to take an AP exam this year, please disregard this email.  
The College Board **ordering deadline for all exams is November 13th**.  Any exam ordered after this date will be an additional $40 late fee. Students need to register and pay for their AP exams using our Total Registration website.    
Our AP exam registration period is from:  
**Friday October 2nd - Thursday Nov. 12th.**  Students will register for their exams on Total Registration and pay online using a credit card.   
[www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/_ENACAD91osnRZl4h8wfh8?domain=user.totalregistration.net)  
The **cost of each test is $98**, and students can request financial assistance if needed.  
In order to access the new, free online resources provided by the College Board, **all students (and teachers) must also register for their class on the Collegeboard website**.  I've attached a document from the College Board, which outlines the steps for students.   
**Step #1 - Register for your exam via Total Registration**  
   
**Step #2 - Join your AP Class Section, using the College Board Website** ([www.myap.collegeboard.org](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/1J1jCBBR6psMnDRjtNUl_4?domain=myap.collegeboard.org)) and use your College Board student account login, as well as your course join code, and fill out the information needed.  (Join codes are given to you via total registration or via your teacher).   
Please let Ms Thomas ([alexia\_thomas@psbmal.org](mailto:alexia_thomas@psbmal.org)) or Ms Kennedy (kate\_kennedy@psbma.org) know if you have questions. If students do not complete both steps, registering and paying on Total Registration and signing up for MyAP on the College Board website, **they cannot order an AP exam** for you.   
   
   
**JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES**
