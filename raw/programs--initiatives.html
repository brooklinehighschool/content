In particular, the project is designed to increase the number of African American and Latino students who enroll and succeed in high level mathematics courses at Brookline High School, culminating with the study of calculus in their senior year. This initiative originates in middle school and offers a series of focused innovations that continue throughout high school. &nbsp;These include summer preview courses that support skill building, reduce summer loss, and prepare students for their subsequent mathematics course by introducing them to core mathematical concepts vital to their success; afterschool tutoring during the school year, where highly qualified mathematics teachers re-teach and reinforce concepts and skills; and the development of “cohorts” that serve to create a less stigmatized academic culture, enhance the aim of striving toward calculus, and provide support among the target population. If you have questions about the Calculus Project or want to join, please contact <a href="mailto:meghan_kennedy-justice@psbma.org">Meghan Kennedy-Justice</a> and <a href="mailto:lisa_rodriguez@psbma.org">Lisa Rodriguez</a><br><br><strong>China Exchange</strong><br>The Mission of the Brookline High School China Exchange Program is to foster personal connections and a climate of mutual cultural understanding between the people of China and the United States.&nbsp;Each year, the China Exchange Program brings a group of eight high school students and one teacher from the Gao Xin School in Xi’an, China for a semester at Brookline High School, and a comparable group from Brookline High School to the Gao Xin School. The program provides participants with an opportunity for personal growth through increased cultural awareness, foreign language competency, and the maturation associated with navigating a new environment.&nbsp;The China Exchange Program enriches the communities of both schools far beyond the impact on the students and teachers who have directly participated since its inception in 1999. The program has fostered a much broader set of personal relationships among members of the two cultures involving school and community leaders, students and faculty, host families and other community members. It is also a powerful symbol of and focal point for the value that Brookline and Xi’an place on mutual understanding in an increasingly interconnected world.<br>For more information,&nbsp;go to&nbsp;<a href="http://bhschinaexchange.weebly.com/" target="_blank">BHS China Exchange Website</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:steve_lantos@psbma.org">Steve Lantos</a><br><strong style="color:rgb(168, 46, 46)">A</strong><strong style="color:rgb(168, 46, 46)">pplications for 2020-2021 CHEX are currently postponed given the coronavirus situation currently in China.</strong><br><br><strong>Global Leadership Program&nbsp;</strong><br>The Global Leadership Program aims to prepare students to understand the challenges of the 21st Century, and to lead for a more prosperous, equitable and peaceful world. The Program includes a class and several trips and a club.&nbsp; Students may participate independently in any of the activities.&nbsp; Any student may apply to participate in a trip. The class is open to 10th-12th graders and students must apply the previous March for acceptance to the class.

Further, students will work frequently in groups and collaborate on design and problem solving challenges, and will practice debate, negotiation, data analysis and leadership. In all of the Program activities, students will develop a global perspective and gain greater insight into the complexity and urgency of challenges that are a concern to us all.<br>For more information, contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:roger_grande@psbma.org">Roger Grande</a>&nbsp;and see our <a href="http://globalleadershipbhs.weebly.com/" target="_blank">website.</a><br><br><strong>METCO</strong><br>The Public Schools of Brookline is a charter member of the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO), a voluntary desegregation program founded in 1966 which provides K-12 education for over 300 students from Boston.
