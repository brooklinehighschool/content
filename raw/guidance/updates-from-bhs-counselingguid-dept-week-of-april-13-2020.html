This time with COVID19 challenges all of our stress levels, our patience, and our strength. There are important messages in this week’s update but the MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE TODAY IS&nbsp;<strong>TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF! REACH OUT IF YOU NEED SUPPORT! BHS COUNSELORS AND OTHER STAFF ARE HERE FOR YOU… AT A DISTANCE BUT WITH AS MUCH CARE AS EVER! PLEASE DO NOT WORRY ALONE.</strong><br>Some BHS students are working to put together an easily accessible resource list for our social/ emotional well-being and basic needs. That resource will come soon. In the meantime, please check out the resources listed below and do not hesitate to contact your counselor, dean, or caring BHS adult. We are here to help and support every BHS student!</div>

Admissions folks are genuinely understanding of the dilemma that high school juniors are worried about regarding college.

I have contacted ACT and they will be delivering another set of score reports to my home in the next weeks. I will be doing some envelope stuffing at my home and then send out these score reports by mail to student homes.<br>We will also be offering a zoom score report presentation, led by BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon, likely during the week of 4/27 – close to the time that score reports should be arriving by mail.<br>Thanks for your patience as we develop a new plan with PreACT score distribution.</div>
