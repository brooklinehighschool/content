This was the first time we met together as a group this school year, and we immediately got to work. Three sophomore representatives, Tina Li, Fabian Ugalde, and Kalina Brookfield, spearheaded a very efficacious poster effort- you’ll see them around school, they look great! We also brainstormed video ideas to promote Student Government around the school, and with that, we went off to class at 9:40, feeling invigorated by work well done. We’re really excited to welcome our freshmen representatives and new Student Council members, so make sure to run or apply for both bodies if you’re interested!</font></span></span><br></div>

We also just recently passed the Right to Rest bill, which states that students are entitled to five minute breaks in periods over sixty minutes, however due to Massachusetts regulations on school hours, this policy cannot go into effect. Legislature has also passed the Feedback Bill, which gives students the right to receive feedback for large exams/projects before the next assessment of the same type.&nbsp; Here is the bill in full:</font></span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700"><font size="4">Section I: A student may not be administered an assessment before they have received feedback for their last assessment (of the same type or content) in that class.&nbsp;</font></span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700"><font size="4">Section II: When the student receives their score, they must be able to know which parts had points deducted (unless it’s an AP course). If a student takes their assessment late, both sections do not apply to them.</font></span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><font size="4">Lastly, for the first time at BHS, elections for legislature will be held in the spring, so make sure to cast your vote! As always if you would like to propose a bill or an issue to your representative, that’s what we’re here for. It’s the perfect time to get involved from just talking with the legislature and student council to joining!</font></span></span><br><span></span><br><br></div>

                  <div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">On Jan. 9th, Legislature debated and voted on a proposed headphone bill, sponsored by seniors Omer Fink and Jack Heuberger, which would allow students to use headphones while seated at the indoor picnic tables. This bill was extremely divisive, with people on both sides speaking passionately. The final vote for this bill broke down to 16 Yes, 10 Against, and 2 Abstentions, thereby leading the bill to fail, as bills need a simple majority of the entire body- 18 votes, to pass this year. This vote was not split among students and faculty, with members in both groups voting both for and against the bill. The sponsors of the bill are hoping to revise the bill and repropose it to the Legislature.

Some members of the body are concerned about how this bill would impact students and teachers with the limited meeting times in the current schedule, as there was a case earlier this year where A block did not meet for an entire week. This bill will likely be voted on in an upcoming Legislature meeting.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Additionally, many bills are being drafted and discussed, such as an International Field Trip Attendance Bill, which would excuse absences in the class that sponsors the field trip. For example, students would not receive absences in French for the French Exchange trip. A bill revising how Health and Fitness credits from activities outside the high school are obtained has also been drafted.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Judiciary has also been hard at work this school year. Early this fall, a student approached the Judiciary to consider taking up the issue of collective punishment.&nbsp; Examples of collective punishment include shutting down a bathroom, picnic tables, or library spaces due to the bad behavior of a few students. After weeks of meetings and discussions, the Judiciary will be writing a letter to the administration with their opinions on this matter and potential alternative disciplinary measures that could be taken in lieu of collective punishment.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you are interested in finding out more about what BHS Government is up to on a weekly basis, who your representatives are, or if you have suggested topics for debate, please visit our website.&nbsp; You can find us on the main BHS website under student </span></span><br><span></span><br></div>

                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><font size="3">We also discussed the issue of T block assemblies sometimes roll[ing over into X block.</font></span></span></li>

                    <font size="3"><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This past week, some members of Student Council also met with Faculty Council. There, we received teachers’ feedback on recent bill proposals, including our updated headphone bill and a grade transparency bill.<br></span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Overall, the majority of the faculty present at the meeting strongly opposed policy allowing additional headphone use -- they believed it would discourage social interaction among students. Although they were willing to allow headphones at picnic tables, they spoke out against the idea of having earbuds during passing times.&nbsp;<br>​</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, the faculty present were against a grade transparency and IPR bill. Many did not want to include letter grades in such IPRs -- some teachers argued that it would only contribute to the competitive BHS environment, while others stated that students should be able to calculate their grades on their own. Despite this, many faculty members seemed to agree with the idea of putting missing assignments on progress reports.</span></font><br><br>​
