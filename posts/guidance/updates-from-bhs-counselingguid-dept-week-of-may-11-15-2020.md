We continue to focus on May as Mental Health Awareness month. We are aware that many students are finding staying engaged with school work during this time to be extremely challenging for many reasons. We understand the stress and frustration of trying to manage parent-guardian work demands while taking on the role of “home schooling” manager for your student(s) at home, especially since many of us counselors and teachers are trying to manage this balance daily in our own homes. These multiple roles can feel exhausting and overwhelming. IPRs for this quarter were posted to the student/parent portals on April 30. Please take a look and check in with your student to see how they are doing now with making progress in their classes.  
  
Feel free to check the [Student and Family Mental Health and Social Services Resource List](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/WeB8C5y1Lxc6R442hz1P32?domain=b-pen.org) on the BHS homepage for regularly updated resources for anyone in the Brookline community. As always, be sure to reach out to a counselor, dean, or other caring BHS staff member if you have any questions or concerns about school or ways to manage during this quarantine time. We’re here for you!
