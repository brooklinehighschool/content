                    <font size="4"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This week’s goal was to further develop our initial brainstorms and settle on one project idea that we felt both connected to and excited to pursue. Everyone was asked to go into our meeting on May 27th with three clear project ideas, narrowed down from the dozen or more we had after last week’s meeting. We split up into pairs and, with other Whipple fellows, discussed our three proposals in depth. We were encouraged to ask our partner as many questions as we could about all of their potential projects, and quickly noticed which ideas we were more excited about as we spoke. Though I was torn between two, my partner helped me combine them into one comprehensive proposal that brought together the best aspects of both.&nbsp;</span><br><br>​&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We left the meeting feeling inspired and with a plan. The rest of the week was spent researching and tinkering with scenes. Since I’ve decided to write a series of vignettes about my experiences growing up as an immigrant and a girl, I’ve been collecting old albums and family stories, as well as going through my own journals from a few years ago to now. Though this meant more time in our dusty attic than I'd have liked, it served me well, as I've been rediscovering new memories every day. We will be continuing this independent work for the next month, solidifying and cleaning up our process, so that we can be all ready to start serious drafting in July.</span></font>
