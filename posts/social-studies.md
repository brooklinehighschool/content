Our Program
-----------

The Social Studies program at Brookline High School has two fundamental goals: to prepare young people to live in a democratic society and interdependent world and to enable students to define themselves on the basis of a broad knowledge and deep understanding of human history and society. The program provides all students with a common foundation of knowledge of both world history and United States history, and subsequently, with the opportunity to study areas of special interest. The curriculum teaches them to explore, analyze and seek meaning in history; to understand themselves as both the inheritors and creators of culture; and to facilitate the achievement of social science literacy and the mastery of learning and thinking skills.  
  
Please [visit our course listing page](/social-studies-course-listing.html) to learn more about the engaging courses we offer, as well as graduation requirements, eligibility and applications for select courses.
