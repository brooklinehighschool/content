**School Day and Schedule**

**When will school start and end?** 

Most days between 8:00 and 8:20 AM, ending between 2:35 and 3:00 PM. In the case of early dismissal on Fridays, students will end their day between 2:15 and 2:35 PM.

**How will the travel time between OLS and 115 Greenough affect student schedules?** 

To ensure that 9th grade students have a full academic and elective experience their school day will be on average 15 minutes longer than that of their 10 through 12 peers.

**Are OLS electives limited as compared with 115?**  

The majority of classes at OLS are for academic subjects, and the majority of classes 9th grade students take at 115 Greenough will be their elective classes. 

**Where will tutorials happen?** 

Tutorials will mostly take place at 115 Greenough, and there will be a limited number at OLS.

**How do after school athletics, participation in the drama department or involvement in any other after school activities work?**

A majority of High School activities will be held at 115 Greenough St. Students will make their way to that building at the end of the school day if they end at Old Lincoln School.

**Where will students take higher level courses, such as advanced math or world language?**

Some advanced math and world language courses will take that course at the 115 campus. For those students, one of their blocks at OLS therefore will be for electives and/or wellness.

**What happens to X-block?**

X-block for 9th graders will happen every other week at 115 Greenough St.  

**How many academic classes will happen per day?**

Most days 9th grade students will have three or four academic classes. Some days they will have as few as two or as many as five.

**When will students get schedules?**

Just like every school year, all BHS students will receive their schedule via Aspsn in the middle of August.

**How are cohorts determined for each student?**

Cohorts will be determined by our computer scheduling process.  Student and families will not be able to select their cohort.

**Do the two cohorts switch campuses at the same time?**

No, in the middle of the school day all 9th grade students will be at OLS. 

**Do students all eat at the same time?**

No. There will be four lunch seatings at OLS.

**Will all students ever be at OLS together?** 

Students will be together during the middle of the day at OLS, but on different schedules. They will also be together during X-block and for Class meetings.

**Will students in each cohort take all their classes with that cohort?** 

Yes. Each cohort will have at least 260 students so just like any year at BHS, students will be in classes with many other students. 

**When will students/families learn which cohort they are in?**

All families will be notified of their start times and campus locations in July. Full student schedules will be published on August 16. 

**Will siblings be in the same cohort?**

Yes, siblings will be in the same cohort and start school at the same location. 

**Cohorted Travel**

**How will cohorted travel work?**

9th graders will either be in a cohort that starts every morning at 115 Greenough Street or a cohort that starts at Old Lincoln School. Most students will take their elective classes (Performing Arts, Career and Tech Ed, Visual Arts and some World Language) as well as support blocks (Learning Center and Tutorial) at 115 Greenough, and they will take most of their major subjects (English, Math, Science, Social Studies, and World Language) at Old Lincoln School.

The cohort that starts at 115 Greenough will travel to OLS after they take their elective classes.  The cohort that starts at OLS will travel to 115 Greenough after they have completed their academic courses. Students will travel in one direction once per day.

**Will the cohorts be set for the entire year?**

Yes. Cohorts are set for the entire year.

**Why did the school decide to do cohorted travel?**

The cohorted travel model aligns with our school vision of what a BHS education should be. The fundamental strength of BHS is the academic, cultural, and social  experiences students have while on campus. By taking classes at both locations, 9th grade students will continue to be exposed to the depth and breadth of our elective program as well as the range of academic supports. Students will have the opportunity to participate in Career and Tech Education, Performing Arts, and Visual Arts which would not be possible if they were just at OLS.

Additionally, having 9th grade students take classes at the 115 Greenough campus will help their transition into the high school and make sure they are familiar with how the school operates. By being at both locations, the Classes of 2023 and 2024 will immediately be able to experience the range of our programs and become full members of our community rather than being cloistered at an off campus site that has a more limited program and fewer opportunities.

**How will students travel between OLS and 115 Greenough?**

Most students will travel between buildings on foot. There will be a bus between the buildings for students who require transportation. The walk takes approximately 13 minutes and the schedule is adjusted to accommodate it. Students will transition between the sites only once per day.

**What is the path that students will take to travel between OLS and 115 Greenough?**

Students will travel from OLS on Boylston Street to Davis Path, which will take them to White Place and then to Davis Avenue.  From there they will walk straight to 115 Greenough Street. This route takes approximately 12 minutes and is approximately 0.6 miles long. Click [here](https://i.imgur.com/UdRJYeO.png) to see the path students will walk through between the two locations.

**What has been done on the pedestrian footbridge by White Place?**

Over the summer, the Department of Public Works will be fixing up steps and repairing the concrete structures to prepare for student use for the fall.

**What type of supervision will be available when students are travelling?**

Administrators, security staff, and Brookline police will facilitate approximately 250-275 students traveling at one time. There will be the ordinary police/crossing guard assistance at specific intersections, but no additional guidance beyond that. 

**How will weather impact travel?   
What happens in inclement weather?**

The primary means of transport will continue to be foot travel between the buildings even in challenging weather. In the rare event that the Brookline Public Health Department declares that outside travel is not safe, we will make alternate schedules and/or travel plans.

**What if my child has an injury?  Will there be a van or a bus to take them between the buildings?**

There will be both a bus and van to transport students between buildings in the event of an injury or mobility issues.

**Where will crossing guards be?**  

The crossing guards will be at Davis and Cypress and Boylston street in front of OLS.  

**Is there thought around blocking off the streets during travel?** 

It is a consideration. Using Davis Ave. as our main travel route gives us the added control of having BPD in place to effect any necessary changes to the traffic patterns. This would not be an option on Route 9 which is state controlled.  

**Transition Logistics** 

**Do teachers travel back and forth each day?** 

Most teachers will be either at 115 Greenough or Old Lincoln School. Some teachers, however, will travel back and forth.

**Will teachers be more flexible with tardies?** 

No, teachers will not be flexible with tardies. There will be a 20 minute passing time between OLS and 115 Greenough which will be enough time to ensure that students will be able to get to class in a timely fashion.

**How will a parent or guardian be notified if a student leaves one campus and doesn’t show up at another?  Who will notice?** 

As with all BHS students, attendance is taken in every block. Any unexcused absence is reported to parents by phone or email the same evening. Parents can also monitor attendance in classes by using the Aspen Family Portal.

**How will drop off/pick up work at the OLS building?** 

Pick-up/drop off will take place on Route 9 as well as on Walnut St.

 
**If all 9th graders can fit at OLS for part of the day, why can’t they fit for the entire day?** 

While all students can fit at OLS for part of the day during their major academic classes, all of the different facilities needed for all of the different types of elective classes would not fit.  We do not have the space or the facilities, for example, to run wellness classes, engineering, computer animation, and cooking at OLS.

**How will traffic on Route 9 be controlled while students are walking?** 

Our walking route will not take students along Route 9. Students will cross Route 9 at the signalized crosswalk directly in front of OLS and then will proceed over the footbridge to White Place and Davis Road and on to the 115 campus.

 
**Busing** 

 
**For students who take the bus to get to school, where will drop off and pick up be?** 

The BHS bus will stop at the 115 campus and at OLS for both morning drop off and afternoon pickup.

**Are there two different buses for both locations?** 

There will be one bus that will loop between the two campus locations. Please note that sign up for the South Brookline bus has already occurred. If you have questions about the South Brookline bus, please contact the PSB Transportation Coordinator Evan Schwartz at [evan\_schwartz@psbma.org](mailto:evan_schwartz@psbma.org)

**Will there be buses for students over 1.5 miles from OLS?**  

No. Only students who live in the South Brookline area qualify for bus service.

**Lockers**

**What is the locker plan?**  

Students who would like a locker will be able to apply for one through an electronic form that will be available closer to the beginning of the school year.

**What happens with sports equipment for students who start at OLS?** 

Such equipment would be brought over by kids when they make the transfer to the 115 campus.

**How will students carry instruments?** 

 
The school owns instruments (tubas, cellos, etc) and the students who travel will use the school instruments during their music classes.  

**Grade Transitions**

**Will there be junior mentors next year?** 

There will not be Junior Mentors in the same fashion we have used them in the past, however, we will have upper class students continue to be part of the transition process and opening days. 

**Will deans stay with their classes?**

No. Rising 9th graders will transition to the deans at 115 Greenough St.

**Clinic**

**Will there be a nurses clinic at OLS?**

Yes, there will be a clinic at OLS and 115 Greenough so students can easily coordinate any health care needs.
