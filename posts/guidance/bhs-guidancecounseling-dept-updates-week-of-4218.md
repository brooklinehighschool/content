**Seniors and Families**  
   
**College Decisions have now mostly been shared....** The BHS Guidance/Counseling Dept wants to congratulate all students who have worked hard and gained admission to a college of their choice! We are also pleased to hear about students who are choosing to head out to work next year or dedicating themselves to a quality gap year experience or other worthy post grad opportunity!  
  
If you have questions about about your next steps, please find your guidance counselor, Mr Libenzon - College Counselor, Ms Cordner - Career Counselor. We will be reaching out to any senior who has not been in contact with their counselor about a definitive plan after graduation, so we can provide assistance in whatever way seems helpful.   

Seniors and parents - PLEASE READ.....

This may also be a defining moment for you as a parent as well...... Read more-
