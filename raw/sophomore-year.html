  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Tenth grade (sophomore) seminars continue the exploration process with the introduction to the concept of a career.&nbsp; The "Explore Careers" aspect of Naviance is used in depth to help students to identify their passions, skills sets, and areas of aptitude.&nbsp; The career is also examined through the lens of the course selection process at BHS with respect to academic, vocational, and the arts courses.&nbsp; Sophomore seminars begin the discussion of presenting oneself beyond the walls of Brookline High School.&nbsp; Students are given their transcripts and presented with BHS GPA calculations and a review of graduation requirements.&nbsp; Counselors speak with students regarding the concepts of "netiquitte" (web privacy and responsibility), the "professional" email address, and the creation of a resume.&nbsp; Students are introduced to the college timetable here as well.&nbsp; Standardized testing, mostly through MCAS administration and PSAT's, is brought up for discussion as well.&nbsp; Sophomore seminars take place during the advisory period beginning in mid March.<br></div>
