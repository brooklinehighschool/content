**​Overview**  
Brookline Summer School has been designed to support Brookline High School students who require additional academic work in order to receive credit for regular school year classes.  In an effort to best support all students, classes will be offered in a variety of learning formats and times.  Students will work with a BHS teacher to complete a 5 week module program that helps them achieve competency in their subject and prepares them for their next year of school.  
  
This year we are pleased to offer supplemental learning opportunities for BHS students.  After a challenging year, our hope is to extend student learning for four weeks in the summer so that students can continue to expand their knowledge.  The Enrichment program will consist of 1 week, intensive, learning opportunities in English, Math, Science and Social Studies.  Rising 9th-12th graders will be eligible to attend each or all of the courses.   
  
**Course Cancellation Policy**  
Courses with fewer than six registered students may be canceled. Parents will be notified of a cancellation by June 25th. Parents are encouraged to explore alternative courses in the event of a course cancellation.  
  
**Curriculum**  
All Summer School courses are based on the Brookline Public Schools Learning Expectations and reflect, where appropriate, Massachusetts State Standards.  In conjunction with the summer school director, it will be determined what each individual student needs to focus on in order to receive credit in the subject area.  An estimated 3 hours per day, per subject is the minimum expectation.    
  
**Financial Aid**  
Students who attend Brookline Public Schools and qualify for financial aid must inform the summer school director during the registration process. Financial aid inquiries should be sent to the Director, brendan\_kobus@psbma.org.
