Brookline High School offers an opportunity for 25 Junior and Senior Latin students to travel to Italy for a week.  This trip will give students an opportunity to examine the classical world of ancient Rome amidst the cities of modern Italy.   
  
This trip will offer Latin students a greater context for the language and give them an opportunity to engage the language in its natural setting: reading texts in the cities where Vergil, Cicero, and Caesar wrote them; reading Latin inscriptions and graffiti throughout the city; and examining the places, i.e. Coliseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon, etc., that were such prominent aspects of the Roman life. Similarly, students will have the opportunity to see the relatively intact cities of Pompeii and Ostia and get a real sense of what life would have been like in the Roman Empire.  
  
In addition to recreating the past, students will be exposed to aspects of Renaissance and Modern Italy- eating Italian cuisine, seeing the Vatican museums and the Sistine Chapel, and experiencing the modern Italian cities of Rome and Sorrento.   
  
Trip highlights include:

*   Walking amidst the preserved ancient city of Pompeii
*   Climbing atop the Villa Jovis, the imperial residence of Emperor Tiberius, high atop the Island of Capri
*   Taking a cooking class on the island of Capri
*   Attending gladiator school and training like a gladiator
*   Visiting the Greek temples at Paestum
*   Driving around the Amalfi coast, location of many Roman summer homes
*   Visiting the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Vatican and Capitoline Museums
*   Visiting modern Italian sights like Piazza Navona and the Spanish steps
*   Going underground into the Catacombs of Rome
