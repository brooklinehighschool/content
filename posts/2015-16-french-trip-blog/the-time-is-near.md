We can't believe it!  We are leaving Saturday evening for Paris!  We will be ringing in Valentine’s Day morning as we arrive in Paris.  As you know, students will be in Paris and Normandy for a week, and then will continue on to their host families in the village of Angers for the following two weeks.  The seven BHS chaperones will be staggered throughout the three-week trip.  We are all very excited!  The past two weeks have been hectic, scrambling to string together last minute details, but we're ready!  
  
Students and chaperones have been actively preparing to make this exchange happen since October.  We hosted the French students and teachers in the fall.  We had a teambuilding event at SkyZone, which was a huge success and lots of bouncy fun!  We held two fundraising crepe sales, which were successful and delicious!  Students canvassed at local businesses.  Students voted on what to include in the Paris itinerary.  Reservations have been made.  It has been a long journey, but we made it, and we're ready for take off!  Thanks to everyone who has supported us and made this trip possible!  
​  
Just to let everyone know, our itinerary is packed during our time in Paris and Normandy, so we may not be able to update the blog as frequently as we will while we're in Angers, but we'll do our best to check in at least a few times before heading to Angers!  Every student will be contributing to a blog post during our stay there, so keep an eye out!  
  
Au revoir,
