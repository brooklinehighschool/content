Registrations are now open for our spring “Is Accounting for Me?” High School conference!  
  
Date: March 6, 2020  
Location: Suffolk University  
1st Floor Function Room for Welcome/Breakfast: 8:30am  
  
Join us to for a day of exploring the accounting profession!   
  
New this year, students will have the opportunity to participate in technology break-out sessions to understand how cutting edge technological advances are affecting the accounting profession and being used by CPAs in their day to day career. Students will have the opportunity to learn about blockchain, data visualization, bots, and virtual reality (and try out some virtual reality goggles!)  
  
The event includes:  
  
•   Interactive activities;  
•   Panel discussions with accounting professionals;  
•   Technology demo break-out sessions  
•   A networking lunch with students and CPA practitioners  
•   An optional tour of the campus  
  
These conferences are appropriate for high-performing juniors and seniors who are considering studying accounting or business at the college level. Each school may bring 8-10 students. Additional students will be placed on a waitlist and will be notified a week before the event if space permits. With your approval, students may come unchaperoned.   
  
There is no fee to attend. For schools with a financial hardship, the Society offers a limited number of grants to reimburse for transportation and substitute teacher expenses. (Register early, first-come, first-served. One grant per school year, maximum amount $100.)  
  
Final details will be emailed to the email address provided approximately 1 week before the conference.

While others like that predictive models can focus on the likelihood to do something – make a gift, perhaps – and not just whether a prospect looks
