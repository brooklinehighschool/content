                    <font color="#818181">​It’s still May, so the focus on Mental Health Awareness continues….and will continue through every weekly update moving forward. It seems many students, educators and support staff, and parents/family members I have been in contact with this past week are feeling the “stuckness” of our quarantine. As an antidote to this vibe, I find many of the short stories shared on the online Grown and Flown app to be relevant and often add some humor to important topics. The short article “How to Get Up and Go When Your Motivation Got Up and Went” by Elizabeth Spencer may hit the mark for many BHS students, colleagues, and parents this week. <a href="https://grownandflown.com/how-to-get-motivated/" target="_blank">The full article is here, with these highlights of her “pep talk”:</a></font>

To that end, we’ll add ideas that pop up on our radar over the next weeks, plus work on updating the BHS Summer Planning Experiences list shared earlier in the spring. Please note that sharing this information is NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF PARTICULAR PROGRAMS.&nbsp; Here’s an example:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bansonnyc.com/" target="_blank"> Banson NYC Virtual Fashion Career Camp</a> (also camps focusing on Fashion Design and Fashion Styling) This week-long program will teach students the fundamentals of the fashion industry by providing an insider's perspective. We will design each camp to spotlight a wide variety of careers in the industry - merchandising, media, design, styling, buying, blogging, public relations, production to name a few. Each week will also include interactive activities like a Master Class in Beauty with your own personal beauty box, a sustainable design project with a chance to win a prize and tips on successful interviewing techniques and appropriate attire to wear. We will end the program with a panel discussion from former students on how they landed internships and advice they have for making your college choice the right fit for you. Each camp will be 18-20 hours long. We will have an orientation on Sunday afternoon and then begin the program on Monday at 11:00 am (NYC time). We accept applications on a first come, first served basis.<br>The cost is $650.00 per student but use code STAYWELL to receive 20% off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;<br>Session A: June 14, 2020 - June 19, 2020<br>Session B: July 12, 2020 - July 17, 2020<br><br><span style="font-weight: 700;">AP exams</span> – We know there have been some glitches and some successes for BHS students taking online AP exams over this past week.

We will continue to update this resource as schools release statements about their AP credit policies.”&nbsp;<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: 700;">SENIORS</span><br><span style="font-weight: 700;">BE SURE TO GO TO YOUR NAVIANCE PAGE AND COMPLETE THE SENIOR EXIT SURVEY BEFORE JUNE 7.
