**Students with January 1, 2, or 15 application deadlines – YOUR TRANSCRIPT RELEASE FORMS ARE OVERDUE! If you have any of these college application deadlines, please see your counselor tomorrow (Monday).**  
**We will try to help you with sending out the school documents needed for those deadlines, but if you are late, we can not guarantee that we can get everything sent by this Friday 12/22. Keep in mind that BHS Counselors/Teachers/ Office Administrative Assistants/Coordinator are all on vacation after Friday so no materials can be sent out over break.**  
**Your responsibility:**

*   signed transcript release forms with colleges and addresses listed/$ to your counselor
*   be sure to do FERPA and match your Common App college list to your Naviance account – WE CANNOT SEND SCHOOL DOCUMENTS UNLESS THIS STEP IS DONE!
*   be sure you’ve talked with your teachers for recommendations
*   let us know if you decide to remove/change a college listed on an earlier transcript release form by emailing your counselor
*   if needed, send your ACT /SAT scores to college admissions now from ACT or College Board website
*   SEE YOUR ORANGE SENIOR SEMINAR PACKET FOR DIRECTIONS FOR ANY OF THESE STEPS

**_Seniors-_**  
**_Have questions about your Common Application? Need essay help? Not sure how to send your scores to colleges? Having trouble matching your Common App to Naviance? Still deciding on colleges to apply to?_**  
**_Juniors-_**  
**_Starting to research colleges? Wondering whether to take the SAT, ACT, or go test-optional? Thinking about when you should take these tests?_**  
   
**_Make an appointment with your counselor (email or leave a note, if needed) OR see Mr Libenzon, BHS College Counselor, in College-Career Center 279 ALL DAY MONDAY 12/18 or in his office Room 162_**  
  
   
Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college? You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please see Kate Cordner, the BHS Career Counselor, on Tues/Wed/Thurs in Room 279 or 280 for more info.  During the month of January, Ms Cordner will highlight alternative graduate plans, including apprenticeship opportunities in Boston area trade unions. Check it out!  
   
   
**Junior and Sophomore Students and Families –**   
   
We hope you attended last Wednesday night’s 12/13 Junior Timeline Overview by BHS College Counselor, Lenny Libenzon AND College Admissions Testing Overview by Summit’s Drew Hailpern. Please see the attachments below for some of the handouts offered. Additional College Planning Guides from SUMMIT will be available in the Main Guidance Office- Room 162 or the College-Career Center 279 later this week.  This presentation was taped by BIG and will be available soon via the BHS Guidance website and grade level PTO emails.  
**IMPORTANT NOTE** – We are pleased to have a Summit representative present to our community, HOWEVER BHS DOES NOT ENDORSE ANY TEST PREP COMPANY. The choice to hire any private test prep firm is that of each student and family. BHS reminds you that free and low cost test prep options are available by talking to your counselor, the BHS College Counselor, or checking the test prep link on the BHS guidance website.
