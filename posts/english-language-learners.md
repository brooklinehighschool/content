Our Program
-----------

The English Language Education (ELE) Program provides services to students whose primary language is not English and who are not yet proficient in English. The program focuses on intensive English language instruction and an orientation to American culture and high school life. Students enrolled in the ELE program take English language courses and may take sheltered history and science courses, depending on English proficiency level and need. Students also take courses from the general school curriculum, and are expected to fulfill all school requirements for graduation.  
  
Placement into ELE classes is determined by interview and assessment. Three levels of coursework (ELE I, ELE II and ELE III) emphasize listening, speaking, reading and writing skills.  Students must register for each group of full-year courses at their designated level. Each level of ELE course work offers 1 World Language credit and 1 English credit.  While enrolled in  ELE courses, students may not register for any English Department course without permission of the BHS ELE staff.  
  
Students in the ELE Program are supported by [Betsy Davis](mailto:betsy_davis@psbma.org), International Student Advisor.
