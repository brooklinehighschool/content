		12/21/2020
	

​We’re almost there! December school vacation is only 2 ½ school days away. Sending holiday cheer to all, no matter how you celebrate! Please find time to relax and be safe.  Special schedule for this short school week -  12/21 will be a Thurs schedule and 12/22 will be a Friday schedule. Thurs/Fri (RF) cohort students will be in-person for the next 2 days. Wed 1/23 will be a regular Wed schedule with students and staff starting their December break at 12:15pm.  See you all in the 2021 New Year!  
**  
​STUDENTS Grades 9-12** **\- If you haven’t completed the Early Warning Data Panorama Survey #2, PLEASE TAKE 10 MINUTES TO DO THAT NOW!**  Several times a year our Early Warning Data Team surveys students on Panorama.  Similar to the first opening days' survey, on this second survey we will ask you questions about how you think and feel. Your teachers, support staff (e.g., guidance counselors, social workers), and school leaders will be able to see your responses. There may also be times where we share your responses with your caregivers. Please respond honestly—there are no right or wrong answers!  Please know that completing this survey is completely optional and your responses will not impact your grades.   
We anticipate that this survey will take about 10 minutes to complete. You can access the link to the survey by using the following link ([https://surveys.panoramaed.com/brookline/login](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/X3RiCpYX2KuyGNmJTGLrba?domain=surveys.panoramaed.com)). When prompted to enter a code, enter which is the year of your graduation, last name, and first initial (e.g., 28DoeJ). Please email Matt DuBois with any questions about taking this survey. THANK YOU!

**FINAL NOTICE!** **From the BHS Nurses: As a reminder, a new state mandate requires that all students get a flu vaccine by December 31, 2020.** **Any questions should be directed to the BHS nurses’ clinics at OLS -** [**April\_Armstrong@psbma.org**](mailto:April_Armstrong@psbma.org)  
**and** [**Jill\_Seaman-Chandler@psbma.org**](mailto:Jill_Seaman-Chandler@psbma.org) **/** [**Megan\_Day@psbma.org**](mailto:Megan_Day@psbma.org) **/ Kate\_Donnelly@psbma.org**    
   
9th, 10th, and some 11th graders – Need some extra academic support in almost any subject area? Your BHS peers are here to offer excellent tutoring help?  
   
**Virtual X Bock Homework Center is now open to 9****th** **graders, sophomores and juniors!**   
The Homework Center is staffed by some extraordinarily supportive peer tutors who are strong in Math, Science, History and English. The Zoom link is  [https://zoom.us/j/98810954213?pwd=c01EdmVpYnVMZDNNTEhxWkpMd0tnZz09](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/cWZCCER6xvcnJ74VSNQk1-?domain=zoom.us)  
Another way to get academic support…..If you would like a **specific subject peer tutor, please contact your teacher or counselor to look into getting connected to a National Honor Society BHS senior.**  
   
   
**Mental health Supports:**  
   
**Students - Feeling down? Always anxious or worried? Concerned about someone else in your life – friend, family member? Not sleeping well because your mind can’t shut down? If these questions sound familiar, please don’t worry alone.**   
**Guidance/school counselors and other clinical support staff at Brookline High are here to listen, assess, and support you so you are not carrying these burdens alone.** Please reach out to your counselor. You can also reach out to a BHS faculty member (including Darby Neff-Verre – Coordinator of BHS Guidance/Counseling) to start the conversation about how we can help you build strategies or get connected to feel safe and better about your situation. Contact your counselor at their email, zoom visiting hours, or phone.  
   
**Family Support Groups offered by BRYT Central**:  
   
As a gift to caregivers during this very difficult time, the Family Engagement Team will be **offering groups that will focus on mindfulness and tools to manage the holiday season on Monday 12/21, Tuesday 12/22 and Wednesday 12/23**. These will be in place of the regular groups. Please see the attached [ParentsSupportingParentsFLYER](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/j86WC82BEAuQvBg8InVZf7?domain=docs.google.com) for holiday schedule changes.  
Please join us for one or all of these fabulous offerings!  
**FYI - the regular weekly BRYT Central Parent Supporting Parents groups will be on hiatus until Monday Jan 4.**   
   
   
**New Resource - DownDog is offering their yoga, HIIT and barre classes to teachers and students for free. Now they are offering a** [**MEDITATION APP**](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/gylDC2k1Wru6lRZgh9akRG?domain=meditation.downdogapp.com/) **for free through the lockdown or at least July 2021 for ANYONE.**   
   
**Need Support? Or Can You Offer Support?**  
**How does Mutual Aid Brookline fit into winter holidays?** MAB has been getting lots of December holiday gift assistance requests, so we put together a list of resources!  
MAB's primary holiday gift resource is a facebook post in our public group, where folks can comment if they have gifts to give or if they're looking for a gift. That post is linked at the top of our holiday referrals google doc, which also includes information about local toy and clothing drives:  
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lsL4jGVwzfHNQr-nSdHhPrgWw1AmhGZQVtryEiR8RyM/edit?usp=sharing](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/VQdjCwpRr5cP93rguVIcnO?domain=docs.google.com).  
Please let us know if you have a program or drive in mind that we should add to this list: we want to get folks connected with resources. And keep in mind, we are always happy to help with subsidized grocery deliveries within Brookline/West Rox, if covering that expense will help free up $$ for folks to buy gifts for their families.  
We recognize that these are only a few of the holidays that people celebrate. Please feel free to reach out to MAB when there are holidays you celebrate if they don't fall into the month of December!  
Our delivery team is trying to get a sense of who will be around to lend a hand with grocery and medication deliveries during this crucial time! If you'll be in town, even if you're not sure how much you can help, please fill out this quick availability form: [https://forms.gle/jQQ9iZvq9DBB6sKu5](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/d1WzCxk715uBwoNPivSbwM?domain=forms.gle).  
   
**HandholdMA.org is a new online initiative from DMH/CBHI to provide comprehensive, accessible, multi-lingual mental health information for parents, caregivers, and families.** Parents-caregivers know their child better than anyone. You may still have a few questions. COVID-19 is putting incredible pressure on families. You might be noticing your child is struggling in new ways, or that old problems are getting worse.  
It answers common questions such as, 'Should I worry?' 'What can I do?' and 'Who can help?'   
Here's the link: [https://handholdma.org/](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/nWWFC68z9yc1BYVVup3UHa?domain=handholdma.org/)  
    
   
**_Winter Break Meals Schedule - December 2020 - Public Schools of Brookline_**  
**Please fill out the** [**Winter Break Meal Order Form**](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/9wakCPN5QlIZMX4PcBbb_e?domain=docs.google.com) **so we can get an accurate count.** It will only take a few minutes and requires just one form per family (not per child). The form **needs to be submitted by December 16th by 5:00pm**, to allow us enough time to order and prepare the meals in time for the first distribution.  
As we approach the upcoming Winter Break, the Brookline Food Service Department is getting ready to provide breakfasts and lunches to any students and families interested in picking up meals. Because we know the number of meals might pose a storage challenge in refrigerators and freezers, we will be distributing meals in TWO separate pickup times for winter break. To pick up meals to cover all eleven days of winter break, please select both pickup dates.  
Pick up dates: Wednesday December 23rd (7 days’ worth of meals) and Wednesday December 30th (4 days’ worth of meals).  
Pick up locations and times: [https://publicschoolsofbrooklineschoolnutrition.com/](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/FRhUCQW57mf9rP6YFQ7CX4?domain=publicschoolsofbrooklineschoolnutrition.com/)  
   
**Reminder - Free breakfast and lunch items are available for FREE for ANY STUDENT in the school district for the remainder of the school year.** If your student needs a breakfast or lunch, have them stop by the cafe at either 115 or OLS. Special order lunches can be pre-ordered at  [Meal Ordering Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeshDUQFUhdroDXctbPeK-UeLynIIaYDleKz7g1pwl-edmT_w/viewform?usp=sf_link)

**Other Community Service Ideas – BHS/ Brookline area:**  
   
BHS student leaders have started the Language Virtual club. They are a **group of high school students who provide free, virtual tutoring sessions to students in Thailand and ESL students in Brookline.** Don't worry, the students are proficient enough in English but they just need help with the conversational aspect.  
Once a student signs up, they match them with a high school teacher, and the student can contact the teacher directly about scheduling. Usually the teaching sessions are only 30min long and you receive community service hours. You can view our website for more details and the sign ups pages: [https://www.languagevirtual.org (Links to an external site.)](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/nygSCXDk5wsGJg45h6fyp5?domain=languagevirtual.org/).

**Reminder - ALL SENIORS MUST EARN WELLNESS CREDIT TO GRADUATE.** Spring athlete Seniors who are **NOT playing their sport** should be scheduled in a Wellness Class now for Semester 2.

**The deadline for applying for BHS scholarships for students attending ANY OTHER college is April 1.

If you have any questions, please contact me at [lori\_lynn@psbma.org](mailto:lori_lynn@psbma.org)    
   
**Thinking of changing sending an ACT or SAT test score after you’ve applied test optional?**   
BHS Counselors are advising students to call each school that they are applying to ask how to manage shifting from test optional to sending scores because there does not seem to be common practice in admissions offices.   
  
  
  
   
**SENIORS – READ YOUR EMAILS!**   
**ALSO BE SURE TO FOLLOW ANY APPLICANT PORTAL DIRECTIONS** for colleges you will be applying to, if they have a portal protocol. Your efficiency in opening up these accounts after applying is sometimes monitored by admissions offices to gauge your level of interest!  
   
**MEFA financial aid events** will all be online this fall.  BHS Guidance partners with the Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (MEFA) each year to provide families with a wealth of financial aid information. This year, due to the global pandemic, MEFA will not be sending their speakers out to high schools. Please visit [https://www.mefa.org/events](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/-O6zCo26yKuBRLQqi1dF7y?domain=mefa.org) to investigate upcoming webinars and take a look at their very informative website.   
   
**College Application Reminders:**  
   
**Help the BHS counselors and teachers support your application process by meeting these deadlines.** Submit your electronic transcript release forms, your self-questionnaire, your parent/caregiver’s “brag” sheet, and give notice to your teachers who have agreed to write recommendations for you**.**  
**If you have college application deadlines for 1/1 or 1/15 and you have not yet completed a transcript release request, please do this step and contact your counselor immediately to confirm.** **Also connect with your teachers regarding recommendations since you are behind in informing these critical BHS staff people who want to do their best to support your college application process.**  
   
**College Deadline**                                            **BHS Deadline**  
February 1                                                                 Wednesday January 6

Seniors – When submitting your transcript release forms electronically, please:

*   **use the updated link** shared by your counselor (on their CANVAS page or by email)
*   be sure to **list your college names and addresses CORRECTLY AS THEY APPEAR OFFICIALLY ON THE COLLEGE’S WEBSITE OR NAVIANCE**. The processing of your request is slowed down by not including the official name of the college or putting in wrong information.
