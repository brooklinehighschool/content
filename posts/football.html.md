Our Program
-----------

Brookline High School offers three levels of football teams during the fall season with a commitment of 5-6 days per week depending on the level. The season begins in the middle of August and runs through Thanksgiving.  
  
The mission of the Brookline Warriors Football Program is to develop greatness, and the way we measure greatness is the impact you make on other people’s lives.  We believe the overall success of any program is determined by the parents/guardians, players, coaches, staff and the entire Brookline community.  Our goal is to instill the values of discipline, teamwork, empathy, and integrity into all aspects of our players lives.
