                  <div class="paragraph"><br>This blog post was written by Madison Allen '23 on July 2,2020<br><br><span><font size="4" color="#2a2a2a">I can hardly believe that we are in our 7th week of working, learning, and growing as writers. During the midst of a global pandemic and a racial justice movement, these past seven weeks have been a reprieve that has given me the chance to direct my energy and my conscious stream of thoughts inwards to my writing. This week we have had 2 intensive workshops that took place on Wednesday, July 1st and Thursday, July 2nd from 9:00-1:00. During our workshops, we underwent a myriad of the following crash courses included, but not limited to character development, narratives, and how to structure your writing. The crash course that I enjoyed the most was about exploring writing utilizing different points of view which allowed me to remain adamant about the message I wanted to convey within my writing but be adaptable in how I conveyed that message.&nbsp;<br>â€‹</font></span><br><span><font size="4" color="#2a2a2a">In the coming weeks, we look forward to deepening our writing skills and hearing from the authors that we all collectively voted on to read their books earlier during the program. On July 15th, we expect to hear from Grace Talusan about her book <em>The Body Papers: A Memoir</em>, on July 22nd we expect to hear from Whitney Scharer about her book <em>The Age of Light</em>, and on July 29th we expect to hear from Danielle Legros Georges about her book <em>The Dear Remote Nearness of You</em>. During the time that we convene with the authors, we will have the opportunity to ask questions about their books and continue to learn how to craft a piece of writing that will ultimately be submitted for publication and be presented in front of a public forum in the fall. I look forward to continuing the work on my project and working with the cohort of other aspiring writers and the esteemed faculty.</font></span><br><br><br></div>
