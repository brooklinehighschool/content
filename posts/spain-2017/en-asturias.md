This weekend we went to the region of Asturias, which is the home region of Ms. Fuertes.  We went to a beautiful beach, and Tazones, a fisherman's village.  We also went to Villaviciosa and Lastres, other villages which were one of the most picturesque places we've been.  We also ate fresh fish, octopus, and squid, which were surprisingly good.
