IMPORTANT NOTE: X blocks have will continue on Tuesdays and Fridays but will move to an afternoon time from 2:25-3pm.  
Please see the BHS schedule (with changing Wednesday blocks) and the PSB district final revision of the school calendar for this year attached to this email.  
   
Seniors have 5 weeks of school… hang in there and do your best!  
Students in grades 9-11 have 9 weeks of school left!  
We Can Do This Together!

   
**ALL PARENTS- CAREGIVERS**  
   
Mark your calendars!  The Public Schools of Brookline is offering a virtual event for parents and guardians of K-12 youth this **Wednesday, April 28, 2021 from 5:30-6:30 p.m.**   
   
**LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IT:  SUPPORTING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF K-12 YOUTH**  
This year couldn't be more different.  As students go back to school, and we all try to move toward returning to some form of normalcy, each of us can be proactive in supporting our children's mental health.  Join Jenna DiLossi, LPC and Young Adult Speaker Elizabeth for a dynamic workshop.  
   
Through relevant examples and easy-to-implement tips, Jenna will provide a framework to understand mental health.  Elizabeth will share her experience as a student who struggled with anxiety and perfectionism, how she hid her struggles, and found positive supports on her path to recovery.  There will be time set aside for questions.  
   
To register:  **https://event.webinarjam.com/register/296/8rxz1sq7**  
   
This event is presented by Minding Your Mind.  The event is being brought to the PSB community through our membership to the Massachusetts Youth Partnership (MPY).  The MPY membership has been generously sponsored this school year by the Brookline Education Foundation.  
If you can't attend the event live, be sure to register to receive a recording of the event that will be available for 7 days.     
   
   
   
**ALL STUDENTS**  
   
**If you missed the student Panorama Survey in Advisory/Hub, here are the instructions for taking this survey.**  
To better support you, your school and teachers would like to ask you some questions about how you think and feel. Your teachers, support staff (e.g., guidance counselors, social workers), and school leaders will be able to see your responses. There may also be times where we share your responses with your caregivers. Please respond honestly—there are no right or wrong answers!  Please know that completing this survey is completely optional and your responses will not impact your grades.   
You can access the link to the survey through your email. In your email, you should see a message from Panorama Education. If you are having difficulty finding the email, you can use this link: https://surveys.panoramaed.com/brookline/login To use this link, you will be asked to enter an access code, which is the first part of your PSBMA email (the year of your graduation, last name, and first initial. For example, 28smithj.) You will need to use all lower case letters. Please email any survey questions to matthew\_dubois@psbma.org  
   
**Survey for AAPI students about racism at BHS**  
In the wake of recent events like the shooting in Atlanta, our community vigil, and discussions with some AAPI students and faculty, APAC (BHS' Asian Pacific American Club) wants to get more information from AAPI students about their experiences at BHS as an AAPI student. This is the first step in being about to make long term, systemic change in our school community. We would appreciate any and all AAPI identifying BHS community members to fill out this form.  
https://forms.gle/ucdrFMRZdRdhFti57  
Thank you for using your voice and being brave. Together we can make change.  
   
**The annual scholarship competition by Brookline American Legion Post 11 just launched!**   
College or college-bound students can win money for school, with $4000 in prizes to be awarded. The assignment is to create a 2-4 minute video about one of the Memorial Squares in Brookline to educate the viewer about the veteran for whom the square is named.

No... you’re not playing a video game! You’ve just landed at the **BHS REVERSE STEM FAIR! Come hear about amazing, non-traditional fields that scientists and engineers are pioneering in the real world and the exciting work they are doing.**   If you think it would be cool to hear about what operating a robot on Mars is really like?  What about, what does a physicist have to contribute to virus research?

The PTO and B-PEN present a special evening with guest speaker Dr. Anjini Virmani, BHS Social Worker Abby Dean, and some recent BHS grads, addressing this milestone from both parent and student perspectives.

Dr. Virmani will share important information about dealing with college student medical needs away from home, including HIPAA health privacy guidelines and a “medical tool kit.”  
   
   
**Financial Aid Award Letters…. Be sure you know what those letters say!**  
Here are some definitions of various financial aid semantics - [http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2021/04/09/financial-aid-award-letters-8-things-to-consider/#more-4753](http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2021/04/09/financial-aid-award-letters-8-things-to-consider/#more-4753)  
   
**Trying to figure out the financial aid packages for colleges you’ve been accepted to?** Look to MEFA (MA Educational Financing Authority) and view this video –  
**https://www.mefa.org/videos/family-webinar-series-after-college-acceptance**  
   
**If your child has not submitted the** **BHS Scholarship Application** **and CSS Profile but plans to do so, please submit it very soon.** The application is easy to complete and is available here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdp0n0dznzcGGiZ12S8sfE57lyshVlD\_DOKqlfyjz\_2yK0l1w/viewform and online on the Brookline High School homepage. To make fair decisions, the Scholarship Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com.  Submit the CSS Profile to code 0424 (the Brookline Scholarship Fund) ASAP too.  The last piece that will be required is your child's financial aid letter from the college they plan to attend. So, once that is decided, have them send Ms Whelan a screenshot/picture of their financial aid letter that college provides (or of their student portal page from the college that shows their financial aid info). Her email is kathleen\_whelan@psbma.org. We know that many students may not make this decision before May 1st.  
Additional Note: The Scholarship Committee uses three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, **unmet financial need**.  There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.    
**Reminder Updates from Senior Deans Williams, Sudmyer, and Redding:**  
**June 6th Graduation:**  
BHS Senior Deans Summer Williams, Ron Sudmyer and Lisa Redding are working with Hal Mason, Anthony Meyer, and many town and district leaders to create the best commencement experience within guidelines from the CDC, the Commonwealth, and the Town of Brookline. We are investigating several options, including an in-person ceremony, to give our Seniors a “walk across the stage” moment.  As it stands, we have outdoor options on Sunday 6/6, our original commencement date. We will communicate directions and decisions in a more detailed manner soon, so please stay tuned. The Class of 2021 deserves a memorable graduation experience.  
**Celebratory Event:**  
Our Senior PTO members have begun meeting and welcoming volunteers to help plan a gathering for seniors.  This group is also monitoring how other districts are organizing events as well.  **Parents/Caregivers who would like to volunteer to help plan, organize or otherwise contribute should contact our awesome PTO partners at copresidents@bhs-pto.org.**  
**Student Senior Steering Committee:**  
For Seniors who are interested in getting involved, please consider joining our Senior Steering Committee led by Dr. Erin Blette.  The Committee is meeting this Friday, March 26, during X-block. **Please email Dr. Blette for more information or to sign-up at erin\_blette@psbma.org.**  
**Yearbooks:**  
The yearbook staff is working hard to create a book that we hope all will treasure. In order to create the best possible yearbook, we are extending our timeline. Unfortunately, this means that yearbooks will arrive in early July. We know that this may be disappointing and we hope that you can understand that we are doing our best under difficult circumstances. And some of us BHS leaders work throughout the summer so we will consider how to supervise and support a yearbook distribution and signing day even if it is in July.   
We will send out more information and opportunities to contribute soon. For now, here are some important announcements.   
· Yearbook and ad purchase deadlines are extended!

STUDENTS' SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS FOR HELPING WITH COLLEGE/POST-HIGH SCHOOL PLANNING  
By the second semester of junior year, family stress ramps up significantly as students try to balance schoolwork, study for SATS, look into colleges or other post-BHS options, etc. All of this comes with a lot of internal and external judgment, even during years when COVID is not an issue. How can families be supportive without adding to the pressure? This year’s BHS Peer Leaders have put together some excellent tips to consider in the **Parent Tip Sheet** Student Suggestions to Parents for Helping with College/Post-High School Planning - [https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655](https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655)
