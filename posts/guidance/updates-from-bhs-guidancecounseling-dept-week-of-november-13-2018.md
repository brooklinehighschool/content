​**ALL STUDENTS**  
**\*\* GIRLS AND STEM – Consider this experience (NOT sponsored by BHS):**  
Girls STEM Summit-Statewide 2019! An annual daylong event for 8-12 grade girls interested in pursuing STEM careers or exploring STEM topics.  
The daylong event will be held on Sunday, March 31, 2019 at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, MA. The registration fee is $67 per student and includes all speakers, hands-on sessions, lunch, and a take home gift. – See attached flyer  
   
\*\* NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) Family to Family offers - **Free Educational Program for Family Members, Partners, and Friends of Individuals with Mental Illness** – 12 session class starts January 10, 2019, Jamaica Plain MA. Preregistration is required and instruction and class materials are free for registered class participants – see attached flyer.  
   
**SENIORS**  
**VERY IMPORTANT…..If you are a senior applying EA or ED deadlines in Oct – Nov, YOU MUST LOOK AT YOUR UPLOADED FINAL GRADES FOR QUARTER 1 ON THE STUDENT PORTAL DURING THE EVENING OF THURS NOV 15.** If there are any missing grades, it is your responsibility to contact that teacher and your counselor on Friday 11/16 to correct this issue. The Guid/Counseling Dept will be reviewing senior transcripts during Fri 11/6 morning and will be sending out this transcript by Wed 11/21 at noon, including Q1 grades, to each school you have applied to early. Admissions offices will be considering this information as they review early applications and make decisions for mid- December.

**SENIORS – Another critical responsibility – Be sure ALL YOUR Q1 WORK IS COMPLETED** for every class so teachers can upload your accurate grade. **INCOMPLETES listed on your transcript are NOT a positive note to admissions and HOLDING YOUR TRANSCRIPT while work is completed may impact your admissions situation. DO YOUR BEST WORK AND MEET DEADLINES!**  
   
The BHS faculty wants to do their best to support you in your admissions process!  
   
**Thursday 11/15 X block** in the College and Career Center Room 279, come learn about **Year Up, a program for 18- 24 year olds that "combines hands-on skills development, courses eligible for college credit, and corporate internships to prepare students for success in professional careers and higher education".**  
For more information visit [https://www.yearup.org/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yearup.org%2F&sa=D&ust=1542229417454000&usg=AFQjCNHZGwz5WLgm1wO2vermRGSWbtg9VQ). We hope to see you there!  
   
**Transcript release / Teacher-Counselor Recommendation Deadlines UPDATE**:  
If you have college applications with **Nov 15 or December 1 deadlines – your transcript release form and other important documents are now overdue**. See your counselor and teachers tomorrow (Tuesday).  
   
If you **change your admissions requests or decide not to apply to a college on your original transcript release form**, PLEASE NOTIFY YOUR COUNSELOR OR STOP BY ROOM 161 (Main Guidance Office) so we can update your requests.  
   
Last note for **EARLY DECISION applications** – remember you cannot apply to more than one ED school. This may also apply to Restricted Early Action applications as well. The Guidance Dept will be in touch with you when we note these errors. Let your counselor know if you are applying ED so they can sign off electronically on the ED form for these applications by deadlines. Thank you!
