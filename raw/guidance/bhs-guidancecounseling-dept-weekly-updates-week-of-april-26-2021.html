Her email is&nbsp;kathleen_whelan@psbma.org. We know that many students may not make this decision before May 1st.<br>Additional Note: The Scholarship Committee uses three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly,&nbsp;<strong>unmet financial need</strong>.&nbsp; There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Reminder Updates from Senior Deans Williams, Sudmyer, and Redding<u>:</u></strong><br><strong><u>June 6th Graduation:</u></strong><br>BHS Senior Deans Summer Williams, Ron Sudmyer and Lisa Redding are working with Hal Mason, Anthony Meyer, and many town and district leaders to create the best commencement experience within guidelines from the CDC, the Commonwealth, and the Town of Brookline. We are investigating several options, including an in-person ceremony, to give our Seniors a “walk across the stage” moment.&nbsp; As it stands, we have outdoor options on Sunday 6/6, our original commencement date. We will communicate directions and decisions in a more detailed manner soon, so please stay tuned. The Class of 2021 deserves a memorable graduation experience.<br><strong><u>Celebratory Event:</u></strong><br>Our Senior PTO members have begun meeting and welcoming volunteers to help plan a gathering for seniors.&nbsp; This group is also monitoring how other districts are organizing events as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Parents/Caregivers who would like to volunteer to help plan, organize or otherwise contribute should contact our awesome PTO partners at&nbsp;copresidents@bhs-pto.org.</strong><br><strong><u>Student Senior Steering Committee:</u></strong><br>For Seniors who are interested in getting involved, please consider joining our Senior Steering Committee led by Dr. Erin Blette.&nbsp; The Committee is meeting this Friday, March 26, during X-block.&nbsp;<strong>Please email Dr. Blette for more information or to sign-up at&nbsp;erin_blette@psbma.org.</strong><br><strong><u>Yearbooks:</u></strong><br>The yearbook staff is working hard to create a book that we hope all will treasure. In order to create the best possible yearbook, we are extending our timeline. Unfortunately, this means that yearbooks will arrive in early July. We know that this may be disappointing and we hope that you can understand that we are doing our best under difficult circumstances. And some of us BHS leaders work throughout the summer so we will consider how to supervise and support a yearbook distribution and signing day even if it is in July.&nbsp;<br>We will send out more information and opportunities to contribute soon.

Students will be able to print out their virtually signed pages and add them to their book when it arrives. This year, we will also give students an opportunity to handwrite messages to the class of 2021 and we will add them to the autograph pages (we will also leave blank space for your individual signatures).<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>SENIORS AND JUNIORS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Are you aware of the New England Tuition Break program?</strong>&nbsp; Basically, if you are accepted to one of the New England <u>STATE</u> schools, you can go there for Mass State Tuition cost IF you are interested in majoring in a concentration that is not offered in MA.&nbsp; To find the list of majors, discounts, and universities, go here:&nbsp; <a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/6AgrCJ67QAugnZn3uVGVKG?domain=nebhe.org/">https://nebhe.org/tuitionbreak/find-a-program/</a>&nbsp; Last year, one of our students went to UConn for the price of UMass by participating in this program.

How can families be supportive without adding to the pressure?
