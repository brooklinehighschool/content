Today we made our way to our final destination, Angers. When the bus pulled into the school parking lot, there were cheers and lots of excitement. After departing from the bus, hugs were shared, bags were collected and off the students went with their host families. Before our 6:00 P.M. rendezvous, however, we made two unforgettable stops. The first to Mont Saint-Michel and the other to Saint Malo. The picture in today's entry, is a group shot from the beaches of Normandy. Until next time...
