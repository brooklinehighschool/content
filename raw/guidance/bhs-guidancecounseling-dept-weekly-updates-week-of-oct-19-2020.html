We are working on a consistent approach regarding phones, but <strong>it is best to contact any counselor by email if needed.</strong><br>Counselors are working closely with these students for advising and counselor recommendation writing. <strong>If a student issue is urgent, please indicate URGENT in the email heading. </strong>Thanks for your understanding!<br>&nbsp;<br>Reminder - All NEW UPDATES will be highlighted in BLUE each week for easy scanning of newest info.<br><br><strong><u>ALL STUDENTS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>“L” Grade</strong> – The “L” grade occurs if a student makes a course level change within the last ten class periods at the end of a marking period, they will receive an L on their transcript for that term grade in the NEW course.&nbsp; The “L” stands for late entry. <strong>This policy is particularly important for SENIORS to be aware of since the L grade may appear on transcripts sent to colleges for Term 1.</strong><br><strong>Any student who thinks they may need to consider a curriculum level change should be talking with their current teacher and counselor during this week of 10/19 to avoid a possible L grade for Quarter 1.</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>New York Times article worth a read for students on managing their own well-being during the pandemic.

To restore healthy sleep habits, make the bedroom a screen-free zone, and have everyone in the family turn off devices an hour before bedtime. If this is not possible, have your children keep a lamp on when using a phone or tablet in bed. Studies show that children have insufficient and poor sleep when they use screens close to bedtime, especially in darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>This week's tip: Breathing Techniques<br>-- <strong>Week #1 10/5/20 tip:</strong> <strong>Certain types of breathing can help calm your nervous system and activate your parasympathetic nervous system</strong>. Try practicing one breathing technique with your children at home once a day.&nbsp;It's good to practice these when calm. Here are some to try out:<br>- <strong>ELEVATOR BREATH</strong> =&nbsp;breathing in when your hand goes up and out when your hand goes down, slowing the speed of the elevator each time.<br>- <strong>2X BREATH</strong> = Breathe IN for 2 count, OUT for 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then IN for 3, OUT for 6,&nbsp;Then IN for 4, OUT for 8. See how long you can make your "out" breath.&nbsp;<br>- <strong>5 FINGER BREATHING</strong> = Breathe in as you trace one finger UP with your opposite hand, breath out as you trace it back down.&nbsp; Repeat for all 5 fingers.&nbsp;<br>- <strong>BOX BREATHING</strong> = Breathe in as you trace your finger up one side of a box, breath out as you go across one side, IN as you go down one side, OUT as you go across.&nbsp; Tracing 4 lines of a box.&nbsp; Repeat and slow the speed of your finger and breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BHS College and Career Center info for all students:</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>ACADEMY OFFERS TWO-DAY VIRTUAL CAREERS IN FILM SUMMIT FOR <u>HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS </u>AND COLLEGE&nbsp;STUDENTS</strong><br>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will present its 6th annual and first virtual&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/s0DBC5y1LxcxN8zvCO0W6A?domain=oscars.org"><strong>Careers in Film Summit</strong></a>&nbsp;on Saturday, October 24 and Saturday, October 31.
