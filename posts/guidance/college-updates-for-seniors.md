Dear Seniors,  
​  
First, please do not hesitate to contact your counselor and/or Mr Libenzon (BHS College Counselor) if you have any questions, large or small!  
  
Since many seniors  are getting admission decisions, please update your Naviance account: this will help our juniors with more accurate data and scattegrams.  Log in to your Naviance, then go to “Colleges I am Applying To,” then click on the little pencil “EDIT” button next to the college, and toggle the options under “Result.” Thank you!

Please email your counselor about the admissions decisions you are receiving. We are here to congratulate you, as well as assist you with disappointments and help turn your attention to other options that work well for you.  
  
​The following update was just released by Brown University, and I think it is applicable to many schools in the country:  
  

*   We, and many of our peer schools, are maintaining the May 1 candidate response date but will consider extensions on a case by case basis. \[Note from Lenny: Check your school’s website to know their deposit date for sure! There are a number of schools that have extended the response date - also known as decision day - to June 1 to allow accepted students more time to get as “virtually connected” as possible to the schools they’ve been accepted to, then make their best decision re: commitment.\]
*   Students whose family financial circumstances have changed as a result of COVID-19 are encouraged to contact the Office of Financial Aid.
*   Students who attend schools that switch from letter grades to P/F grades will not be penalized. \[Note from Lenny: As of  right now, there is no decision on grading from BHS, but we will be focusing on this important issue with renewed focus now that MA public schools are mandated to be closed until 5/4. We have heard from many college admissions offices that they are very aware that all current seniors in US high schools are in very challenging and fluid times around all parts of their education, grading, etc. Admissions representatives understand this issue and are considering all circumstances with the bottom line to be supportive to young people. \]
*   We understand that standardized testing administrations have been suspended for the spring; our testing policies remain the same for now, but we will revisit this topic in the early summer. Students who had been planning to take AP Exams will not be required to sit for the new online option, though they may take them if they wish, for learning purposes. \[Note from Lenny: You will be able to take APs at home on two possible dates. College Board is working on the details.  It will be a 45-minute exam. If you registered for an AP exam at BHS in May, you should have received an email from the BHS AP coordinators. You will be hearing more from your AP teachers and BHS administrators very soon about our suggestions for best practices in dealing with this new version of AP exams, including supporting students who may not have the needed technology or environments to do AP exams at home as well as managing situations for students with approved accommodations.\]
*   Brown is currently considering whether the new online AP Exam will count towards credit, placement and advanced standing. Matriculating students will find out more over the summer.

Be well and contact us at Brookline High Counseling/Guidance if you have any questions, concerns, or just need to talk!
