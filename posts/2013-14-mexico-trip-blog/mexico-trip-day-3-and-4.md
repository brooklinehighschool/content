**La comida  
They feed us a ton! Nothing compares to the real Mexican food that we enjoy here. Quesadillas, salsa, rice and beans, fruits and even cactus are part of our daily diet. When we first came, many were surprised to be served with so much authentic food. We are constantly eating during our frequent breaks at the cafeteria. A big change for us has been getting used to small dinners and huge lunches with the whole host family. No matter what, no one goes hungry.

**Taxco  
The drive from Cuernavaca to Taxco was about an hour and a half. However, the breathtaking views made it worthwhile. Taxco is located on the side of a mountain, filled with beautiful scenery as well as a surplus of shops. Bargaining made everything easier; we were able to talk down almost every vendor to a lower price. Known as the silver city, Taxco lived up to its name. Almost every shop sold some form of genuine silver, from necklaces to rings to bracelets to earrings. The center of Taxco was made up of a square containing a Gazebo and a beautiful church that could be seen from over a dozen of different angles. The inside of the church was amazing; the high ceilings and brilliant paintings captured the feel of the 18th century perfectly. Although the church is a historic site, many people still utilized it for prayers and worship. The streets were filled with activity, and the smells of churros and fresh fruits. As you get further into the city, the views get more and more spectacular. The narrow streets were a bit difficult to navigate, especially with the uphill commotion of taxis, mopeds, and street vendors. Pierce and Myles**

**Las clases  
The classes are most days from 8:00 to 2:00. We are taught in a personal classroom environment tailored to our learning needs and Spanish level. Most classrooms have five people and the biggest is no more than seven. In my class, the environment is very relaxed. We spend our time learning about grammar and occasionally getting side-tracked by conversation (in Spanish) with our teacher. It’s very interesting to explore differences between Mexican and American culture. We share stories of cultural understandings and misunderstandings and discuss controversial topics. For example, did you know gay marriage is legal in the city of Mexico, but same-sex couples aren’t allowed to adopt? Sometimes even the grammatical lessons can turn cultural. We educated ourselves about the heated issues while improving our Spanish at the same time. - _Tyler_

**Baile   
Two days a week we all gather in a room and learn dances of the Dominican culture. During this activity not only do we have fun but learning the steps brings us closer together. It's really fun and a great experience for everyone. I feel that this activity pushes us to take risks but also lets us have fun with each other.

**Intercambio español-inglés  
  
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we have an hour of conversation time with students studying Mexico at Cuanahuac.  Each of us was paired up with one or two students and given time to get to know each other.  On our first day, we started with a half an hour in English and then moved on to a half an hour in Spanish.  My partner, a 16 year old boy named Fabian, spoke English very well -- probably much better than I speak Spanish! (Upon being pressed for an answer, Fabian described my accent as "intelligible.")  I really enjoyed getting the chance to get to know some more of the locals and to practice my conversational Spanish.  Hasta luego!  -**
