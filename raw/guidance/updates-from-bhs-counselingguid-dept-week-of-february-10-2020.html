DEADLINE APRIL 15, 2020 - </strong>Civil discourse is a concept that goes beyond a simple dictionary definition, and understanding it involves a combination of personal experience and ‘big ideas.’ Perhaps it is something you recognize from an occurrence in your own life. Maybe you can easily recognize when it is missing. Differing perspectives are a key part of learning, of democracies, and of civil society. For this essay, we ask you not only share your comprehension of what civil discourse is meant to be but to also relate what it looks like when it works – and when it doesn’t – and why. Perhaps you will choose to include mention of a time when you, yourself, were part of an exchange intended to understand something – how did you go about it? We encourage you to bring emotion, creativity, specific examples (including current events), and well-researched facts into what you write. A good essay will demonstrate how civil discourse is not just an abstract idea, but is, in fact, action inspired by constitutional principles, and demonstrated through civic virtues. We want to know what you think civil discourse truly means.<br>The winners of this year’s contest will receive:<br>1st Place – $7,500 and a scholarship to our 2020 Constitutional Academy in Washington, D.C.Runners Up – 5 prizes at $1,500 eachHonorable Mentions – 8 prizes at $500 each<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579225303304000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GrnQJjZUt5CPBwHWSURZR">https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/</a><br><br><strong>UPDATED BHS Clubs/Organizations Info for students:</strong><br><strong><u>Interested in Medicine?

Just stopping by to say thanks and let them know where you stand with admissions or writing a quick note makes a BIG difference to those who helped you!<br><br>As College Counselor Tara Anne Dowling suggests-<br>“Say 'Thank you' as well as 'No, thank you'&nbsp;<br>--‘Thank you for taking time with my credentials’, ‘thank you for answering my questions’, ‘thank you for offering me a scholarship’ etc.<br>--‘No, thank you, I will be attending another college’ (you can say the name of your attending college if you feel comfortable)<br>This is done in myriad ways:<br>* via the online portal they may give you the option to decline your offer and say where you are going<br>* via email to the rep who has been working with you<br>* via post--did you get a big packet in the mail? There may be a postcard that asks for you to respond with info if you are declining the offer<br>What is goodwill and why does it matter?<br>--Admission officers very often become invested in the students they are reviewing. They have read your file, recommended you to the admission committee, and perhaps put you up for a scholarship. Hard work deserves a big thank you.<br>--You never know if you may need to transfer<br>--You may have a younger sibling or friend who will attend this university. How can a good relationship that helps other people be a bad thing?<br>What's in it for me?<br>--If good will doesn't move you (or good manners!) then think of kids on waitlists who are dying to find out if they can have that place that is currently being held by you. You can help colleges clean up their records and make room for other candidates!<br><strong>READ YOUR EMAIL IF YOU HAVE APPLIED TO COLLEGE! Set up and check your portal for each college. If you have questions, students (not parents) should be contacting the admissions offices!</strong><br>Although over 83% of the BHS Class of 2020 has applied to college as of 2/9/20, there are still seniors working on their post- high school plan. There are many 4 year colleges still accepting applications or considering other post high school options, so see your counselor, Mr Libenzon/BHS College Counselor, or Ms (Cordner)Kennedy/ BHS Career Counselor for support.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college? You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please see Kate Cordner Kennedy, the BHS Career Counselor in Room 279 or 280 for more info.&nbsp; If she is not available when you stop by (since she is also working with 9th graders at the OLS campus), please leave her a note!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>SENIORS AND JUNIORS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Who requires Subject Tests?
