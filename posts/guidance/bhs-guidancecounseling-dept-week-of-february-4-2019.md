Some suggested pre-college opportunities with financial aid available - [http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/](http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/)  
Please note that attending a pre-college program at any particular college does not usually offer any special consideration during future admissions at that school.  
   
**CURRENT 9th, 10th, 11th GRADERS**  
   
Thinking of a different educational experience at Brookline High next school year?  
Maybe **SWS (School Within a School) or ACE** are the right fit for you? Both programs are open to current 9th, 10th, and 11th graders to apply.  
   
**APPLICATIONS FOR SWS** The BHS School Within a School SWS app deadline extended! Now, applicants will have until February 13th to visit a SWS class, and a SWS Town Meeting.   
All applicants need to fill out the google form, and download the packet, found at SWSBrookline.org.  Also, all applicants must attend a mandatory admissions meeting during X Block on February 14th.

**SENIORS**  
 **BHS specific, General and BU, Northeastern Scholarship Info**:  
More details available here on the BHS Guidance website and the the BHS February Scholarship letter - both below.  
The Brookline High Scholarship Committee would like parents to know that we use three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, unmet financial need. There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.   
Specific applications are now available for tuition scholarships to Boston University (2 full-tuition renewable scholarships) and Northeastern University (2 half-tuition renewable scholarships). Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2019 BHS Scholarship Application. Applications must be completed ASAP.   
The deadline for applying for all BHS scholarships for students attending ANY OTHER college is April 1. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code #0424. Please use the same application as above.

Beware of scholarship and other financial aid scams! This website can help you spot scams and avoid wasting your money.  
    
**READ YOUR EMAIL IF YOU HAVE APPLIED TO COLLEGE!** **Set up and check your portal for each college. If you have questions, students should be contacting the admissions offices, not parents….. See this article for more info about documents to college -** [**http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2018/11/21/parents-before-you-yell-at-your-childs-school-counselor/**](http://admitted.nacacnet.org/wordpress/index.php/2018/11/21/parents-before-you-yell-at-your-childs-school-counselor/)  
   
If you **change your admissions requests or decide not to apply to a college on your original transcript release form**, PLEASE NOTIFY YOUR COUNSELOR OR STOP BY ROOM 161 (Main Guidance Office) so we can update your requests.  
   
**Upcoming College Application Deadlines  (Feb 15, March)** - Remember that you are responsible to get all needed documents to your counselor, teacher, and the BHS Guidance office 4 weeks before your college deadline. Needed documents include: completed transcript request form, student self-questionnaire, parent brag sheet, list of colleges to any teacher who has agreed to write your recommendations. See your counselor if you have any questions.  
   
**Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college?** You are not alone! Almost 10% of last year’s BHS graduates planned to attend a 2 year technical or community college, work full time, or considered the military. Please see Kate Cordner, the BHS Career Counselor, on Tues- Friday in Room 279 or 280 for more info.
