                    <font color="#2a2a2a" size="4">Emelia here!<br>This week, we began our "up drafts". Basically, the idea is to give our "downdrafts" a sense, as Mr. Berman wrote, of "whole." Personally, I've found this really exciting and interesting as it's given&nbsp;me a chance to look back at what I've been working on and see the concepts I introduced than forgot about, create a more distinct narrative, and further develop the voice of my character. We also filled out outlines, for those of us writing a story, there was a fiction plotting activity and, for those doing poetry, a poetry anthology activity.<br><br>At our weekly meeting, we had our second author visit from&nbsp;Whitney Scharer, author of The Age of Light. It was so lovely to be able to talk with her and hear about her experience writing, researching, and publishing The Age of Light. She had many great tips for us and we got to learn more about her book, which many of us have read. For me, I found this experience especially helpful because, like Scharer did, I am writing historical fiction.&nbsp;<br>â€‹<br>We've continued to meet one-on-one for boosts, which I've found to be endlessly motivating. There is nothing like having someone clap for you and you getting to do the same for them. I love hearing other fellows work and it's really nice to be able to talk to people who are going through the same process that you are,&nbsp;that are feeling similar feelings, and encountering similar difficulties.</font>
