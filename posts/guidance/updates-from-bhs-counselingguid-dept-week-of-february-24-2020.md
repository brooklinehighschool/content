From deciding which school will be the best fit, to interactions with professors and peers, facing roommate situations, handling money, homesickness, finding work, overcoming setbacks, staying on track to graduate– these students come up against aspects of college life students typically encounter.

**Brookline Community Service Opportunty!**  
  
**A collaboration between Center Communities of Brookline and Wentworth Institute of Technology offers a chance for BHS students to participate in service to others and get community service credit. Details here:**  
**Every other year, Brookline community partners join Center Communities of Brookline (the event sponsor) to organize a Senior Health Fair.**  This year’s event will be the 2020 Health Expo with a focus on Technology - innovations, resources and opportunities to support older adults.  With an aging population growing faster than ever before, opportunities to highlight and demonstrate innovations for sight, sound, mobility, connectivity and transportation offer such a resoundingly positive experience for older adults in Brookline, as well as those families with older loved ones.   
There may be an opportunity for 10 BHS students come to Wentworth (sometime in March) for a workshop and lunch with their students from different disciplines and attend the June 4 Expo to interact with the other Expo attendees. Any interested students should check in with Ms Lisa Gaffney, the BHS Community Service Coordinator, in Room 161.  
   
**Coronavirus Information and Medical Supply Drive:**  
**BHS Clinic Update re Coronavirus** – PSB school health services will continue to stay informed of updates regarding the coronavirus. We work collaboratively with the Brookline health department, and the state health department, as well as listen to CDC conference calls when they are given, and daily review the CDC website for updates.  Our schools continue to follow the guidelines given by the CDC, whose main goal is to protect public health and safety.   
While the coronavirus continues to be a rapidly evolving situation, the CDC and DPH state that the risk to Massachusetts residents remains low at this time.  
We can all do to help prevent colds and the flu can help protect us against other respiratory viruses as well:  
\*\* Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds  
\*\* Cover your coughs and sneezes   
\*\* Stay home if you are sick  
  
**Medical Supply Drive Information:**  
I am a senior at BHS and from the WuHan community in China.  As you know, this is a very serious situation and my relatives there have expressed the importance of having more access to face masks and other medical supplies.  As a result, I am launching a collection of medical supplies on Tuesday, February 4th by putting collection boxes in several key locations within BHS (including the atrium, the cafeteria, and next to the library).  I have contacted the Harvard Medical School Chinese Student Association who are working with me to guarantee a way to mail the supplies in the coming weeks.  I will keep these boxes out until the end of February.  According to several hospitals in WuHan, the most urgently needed supplies include:  
  
  

*   3M N95 masks (serial #1860/1860s/1870) that have a Fluid Resistant Claim and an Airless valve
*   Medical Safety Goggles / Protective Eye gear (must cover the whole face)
*   Medical disposable latex gloves
*   Medical protective clothing （must meet Level 4 Biohazard Laboratory requirement)

 All of these items, except for the medical protective clothing, can be ordered from or found at: Amazon, Ebay, or Home Depot. I greatly appreciate your consideration to help my hometown and all the surrounding areas that are being devastated by this virus.

**Bill of Rights Institute sponsors the** **2019-2020 We the Students Essay Prompt - What does civil discourse mean to you? DEADLINE APRIL 15, 2020 -** Civil discourse is a concept that goes beyond a simple dictionary definition, and understanding it involves a combination of personal experience and ‘big ideas.’ Perhaps it is something you recognize from an occurrence in your own life. Maybe you can easily recognize when it is missing. Differing perspectives are a key part of learning, of democracies, and of civil society. For this essay, we ask you not only share your comprehension of what civil discourse is meant to be but to also relate what it looks like when it works – and when it doesn’t – and why. Perhaps you will choose to include mention of a time when you, yourself, were part of an exchange intended to understand something – how did you go about it? We encourage you to bring emotion, creativity, specific examples (including current events), and well-researched facts into what you write. A good essay will demonstrate how civil discourse is not just an abstract idea, but is, in fact, action inspired by constitutional principles, and demonstrated through civic virtues. We want to know what you think civil discourse truly means.  
The winners of this year’s contest will receive:  
1st Place – $7,500 and a scholarship to our 2020 Constitutional Academy in Washington, D.C.Runners Up – 5 prizes at $1,500 eachHonorable Mentions – 8 prizes at $500 each[https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/&sa=D&ust=1579225303304000&usg=AOvVaw1GrnQJjZUt5CPBwHWSURZR)

Thinking about an alternative plan to 4 year college? You are not alone!
