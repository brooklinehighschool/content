Mental Health America ([https://www.mhanational.org/mental-health-month](https://www.mhanational.org/mental-health-month)) offers this important reminder - **It’s important to accept the situations in life that we cannot change, actively work to process the mental struggles associated with big changes, manage anger and frustration, recognize when trauma may be affecting your mental health, challenge negative thinking patterns, and make time to take care of yourself.**    
A more detailed overview of important way to “adapt after trauma and stress” is attached but consider these points:

*   Process your thoughts
*   Connect with trusted people
*   Don’t compare your experience with others
*   Take care of your body
*   Know if will take time
*   Give yourself grace
*   Don’t feel ashamed to ask for help

**SENIORS**  
**CONGRATULATIONS to all seniors who have proceeded through the college process and have now made the decision about your next step after BHS graduation!**  
**If you are still sorting out your plan, we may be in touch with you to offer support and resources.** **If you would like to reach out, please contact your counselor, dean, special education liaison, or other trusted BHS adult so we can work with you to have a plan that you are proud of and excited about as you leave the BHS community.**  
   
**All seniors need to complete the SENIOR SURVEY before they graduate.**  It is now available on Naviance. Please complete it as soon as possible. Here are the directions:  Once in Naviance, click on About Me in the top right corner, and then select My Surveys.  Under My Surveys, select Surveys Not Started, and then Senior Survey.  
The survey is for everyone, including students taking gap year, working, going to military, etc.  
NOTE: If you have applied to college, it is really important that you tell us the results for every college you've applied to, since this is the info we rely on to advise juniors.   
**Also, please make sure that you tell us which college they are going to in question 1. This is where we will send the final transcript!**  
   
   
**Heading to college and haven’t completed your FAFSA financial aid form yet? NOW IS THE TIME!**

**Do this now if you haven’t already….**  
**If your child has not submitted the** **BHS Scholarship Application** **and CSS Profile but plans to do so, please submit it very soon.** The application is easy to complete and is available here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdp0n0dznzcGGiZ12S8sfE57lyshVlD\_DOKqlfyjz\_2yK0l1w/viewform](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/KA1VCwpRr5cgl6qpHV0Mae?domain=docs.google.com) and online on the Brookline High School homepage. To make fair decisions, the Scholarship Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com.  Submit the CSS Profile to code 0424 (the Brookline Scholarship Fund) ASAP too.  The last piece that will be required is your child's financial aid letter from the college they plan to attend. So, once that is decided, have them send Ms Whelan a screenshot/picture of their financial aid letter that college provides (or of their student portal page from the college that shows their financial aid info). Her email is [kathleen\_whelan@psbma.org](mailto:kathleen_whelan@psbma.org). We know that many students may not make this decision before May 1st.

*   Additional Note: The Scholarship Committee uses three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, **unmet financial need**.  There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.

**SENIORS AND JUNIORS**  
   
**Here’s a post high school plan different from the college route-** **The Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) is an AmeriCorps program that offers an alternative to college in a gap year format.** Applicants must be at least 17 years old, have a high school diploma or GED, be willing to comply with a criminal background check, and be a US Citizen or US National or Permanent Resident Alien. The application has now opened!  
   
The Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) is an AmeriCorps program dedicated to increasing youth academic enrichment and college and career exploration through Out-of-School-Time (OST) interventions and data-driven programming. We are a passionate team that strives every day to empower young people to succeed as part of a national movement to achieve education equity. We do this because we believe that all young people have a right to Caring Adults, Safe Spaces, A Healthy Start, An Effective Education, and An Opportunity to Serve.  
   
As a Mass Promise Fellow, participants serve at one of our partner youth-serving programs at schools, city agencies, or community-based organizations in Massachusetts. Their mission will be to build intentional relationships with young people between 6th and 12th grade and support their academic engagement or post-secondary success. Fellows will work to decrease the dropout rate, close the opportunity gap, and support the futures of youth. If someone believes in the power of relationship building to positively impact the life of a young person, this role is for them.  
   
MPF's training curriculum, networking opportunities, and career coaching provide our Fellows with the opportunity to increase their leadership development and gain meaningful skills needed for careers in the education and non-profit sectors. On average, 25% of Fellows are hired by their host site for full-time employment following their year of service. Within three months of graduating from MPF, 95% of our Fellows have full time employment or are continuing school.  
   
Students can learn more about MPF, the benefits of our program, and our host sites across Massachusetts at https://masspromisefellows.org/apply

STUDENTS' SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS FOR HELPING WITH COLLEGE/POST-HIGH SCHOOL PLANNING  
By the second semester of junior year, family stress ramps up significantly as students try to balance schoolwork, study for SATS, look into colleges or other post-BHS options, etc. All of this comes with a lot of internal and external judgment, even during years when COVID is not an issue. How can families be supportive without adding to the pressure? This year’s BHS Peer Leaders have put together some excellent tips to consider in the **Parent Tip Sheet** Student Suggestions to Parents for Helping with College/Post-High School Planning - [https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655](https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655)
