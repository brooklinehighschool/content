Please find time to relax and be safe.&nbsp; Special schedule for this short school week -&nbsp; 12/21 will be a Thurs schedule and 12/22 will be a Friday schedule. Thurs/Fri (RF) cohort students will be in-person for the next 2 days. Wed 1/23 will be a regular Wed schedule with students and staff starting their December break at 12:15pm.&nbsp; See you all in the 2021 New Year!<br><strong><br>​STUDENTS Grades 9-12</strong>&nbsp;<strong>- If you haven’t completed the Early Warning Data Panorama Survey #2, PLEASE TAKE 10 MINUTES TO DO THAT NOW!</strong>&nbsp; Several times a year our Early Warning Data Team surveys students on Panorama.&nbsp; Similar to the first opening days' survey, on this second survey we will ask you questions about how you think and feel. Your teachers, support staff (e.g., guidance counselors, social workers), and school leaders will be able to see your responses. There may also be times where we share your responses with your caregivers. Please respond honestly—there are no right or wrong answers!&nbsp; Please know that completing this survey is completely optional and your responses will not impact your grades.&nbsp;<br>We anticipate that this survey will take about 10 minutes to complete. You can access the link to the survey by using the following link (<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/X3RiCpYX2KuyGNmJTGLrba?domain=surveys.panoramaed.com">https://surveys.panoramaed.com/brookline/login</a>).
