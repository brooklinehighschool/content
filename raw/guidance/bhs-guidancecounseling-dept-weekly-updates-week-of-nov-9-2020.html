                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>NEW Weekly Hybrid schedule to accommodate safe inside lunches for all students in the OLS and the 115 buildings starts this week</strong>&nbsp; -See Head of School Meyer’s Saturday email and see attached schedules here for both OLS and 115</li>
                      <li><strong>Hybrid schooling has started for 9th graders at OLS for the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;</strong>It continues to be a pleasure&nbsp; with some challenges as many 9th graders attend in-person classes at the OLS building. Cohorted travel will start for in-person 9th graders on Monday so they will also be experiencing the travel between OLS and the 115/ Unified Arts Buildings starting Monday 11/9 too. The increased engagement with teachers and curriculum for elective and wellness classes should be helpful for many students.</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;<strong>Hybrid schooling for students in Grades 10-12 will start this Monday November 9. BHS faculty and staff are excited and anxious about this shift…&nbsp;</strong>Staff is looking forward to seeing many students in-person for the first time this year. All students and families should be patient as we enter into yet another positive and new stage of teaching/learning/supporting this school year!</li>
                      <li><strong>ALL BHS STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE REMOTE WEDNESDAYS&nbsp;</strong>as we move forward.&nbsp;<strong><u>NO SCHOOL THIS WEDNESDAY Nov 11 for Veteran’s Day holiday.&nbsp;</u></strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Quarter 1 ended this past Friday, November 6.&nbsp;</strong>The school year moves along fast! Student report cards will be posted on the student/parent portals on Thursday Nov 19. Keep up the good work for students who started this year strong! For those who had some challenges… it’s a new quarter. Make some constructive changes, reach out for extra help, you can do this!</li>

Testing will then be moved inside to the Denny Room, located on the lower level of the Brookline Department of Public Health Building, accessed through the Harvard Street entrance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Testing is available for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, however, only the costs for those displaying symptoms will be processed through the patients’ health insurance provider. Asymptomatic and uninsured individuals will be required to pay $140. Asymptomatic individuals who seek testing may request reimbursement for the expense through their insurance company.<br>We are hopeful that this testing site will provide a convenience for parents, students, and staff to undergo timely testing when symptoms develop, to identify positive cases quickly, as well as to allow for a quick return to school when tests are negative and symptoms have resolved.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To facilitate contact tracing within the schools, staff or students who live outside of Brookline must sign a consent form allowing the test results to be sent directly to the Department of Brookline Public Health, in addition to the health department of the individual’s home residence.<br>&nbsp;<br>School nurses will continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Brookline Public Health to identify close contacts of positive cases within the school setting.&nbsp; An individual’s local board of health will continue to manage the positive cases of their community. This partnership allows for a quicker review of close contacts within the school system and determination of school attendance.<br><br>

This is a wonderful way to learn more about colleges, ask important questions, and show demonstrated interest!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>SENIORS AND JUNIORS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Great quick read from Grown and Flown about college fit in the college search process </strong><strong>- written by Adam Weinberg, President of Denison University in Ohio (so there is some Denison specific encouragement). The article also does not cite virtual college search and visit expectations at this time due to the pandemic….but helpful for juniors/seniors and their parents-cargivers to consider </strong><strong>- </strong><a href="https://grownandflown.com/college-fit-why-important/?utm_source=Grown+%26+Flown+Email+Subscription&amp;utm_campaign=fd9c472e65-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_07_01_34&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_fc15798a65-fd9c472e65-246876214"><strong>How to Help Teens Find a Good College Fit, From a University President</strong></a><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Did you miss the Gap Year presentation on Nov 5?

So students feel comfortable registering by the fall deadline, there will be no fees if a student decides not to test or to cancel their exams. An additional $40 fee only applies to each exam ordered after this deadline.<br>Please remember there are two steps in the AP exam registration process.<br>#1.
