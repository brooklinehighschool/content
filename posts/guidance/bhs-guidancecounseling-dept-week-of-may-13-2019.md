About Colleges That Change Lives  
Colleges That Change Lives (CTCL) began as a loose collaboration among the 40 schools profiled in Loren Pope's classic book, Colleges That Change Lives. For over 20 years, our programs have given thousands of students and parents guidance in their college search. In 1996, the colleges and universities formed a non-profit organization to keep Loren’s message alive – the college search should be about finding a list of colleges that are a good academic, social, and financial fit. The non-profit has 45 member colleges and universities; each member institution has been profiled in at least one version of the book. Learn more:

**BHS Summer School course-**   
**COLLEGE TEST PREPARATION**:          8:30-11:00 or 11:00-1:30          **enrichment**  
PSAT/SAT and ACT Test Prep)\\This course is designed to familiarize students with the newly revised Scholastic Aptitude Test of the College Entrance Exam Board (CEEB) and the American College Testing (ACT) exams. This class will focus on the SAT, but if many of the students are taking both tests (SAT & ACT) the course can become even more individualized for student’s preferences and needs.  Students will be provided with test taking skills, sample questions, and full-length tests.  Recommended for rising 11 and 12th graders.  With our specific instruction, students have achieved results comparable with those promised by private SAT/ACT prep courses. Session I and II verbal will present the same material. Session I and II math will present the same material. (Tuition includes the cost of the official College Board textbook).  
**Dates:**           
  
**Session I: 7/1 - 7/19**
