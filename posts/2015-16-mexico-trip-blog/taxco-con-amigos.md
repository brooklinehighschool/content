Yesterday after morning classes, we went to the town of Taxco. After the two hour bus ride we arrived in the very picturesque town, known for its mining of minerals such as silver, gold and copper. The mines are so deep that tourists can't go in them so instead we went to a silver store which had a replica of the mines. The stores that sell jewelry have tables covered in hundreds of earrings, bracelets and necklaces, so many that is hard to focus on just one item. We then walked through the narrow streets to the center of town where the baroque style cathedral is. The cathedral is covered in gold and ornate sculptures of the Virgin Mary, the Heart of God and many other Catholic figures. After spending some time shopping, we went to a restaurant with a gorgeous view of the town. We got back on the bus exhausted but having had a great time. - Emma
