In the spring of 2020, when school was closed and classes went remote, Student Council continued to meet with Legislature and Judiciary.  Members were very active and met virtually.  Member of the council helped to create a student survey and sent a joint letter to admin about questions and concerns that students were expressing during this difficult time.  Go to the Legislature blog to see a copy of the letter.    
  
In addition, the Student Council completed the club fund allocation for the 2020-2021 school year.  
  
Also, congrats to Claire Gallion for being elected student representative to School Committee!
