Athletics Online Registration
-----------------------------

**The following steps must be completed before a student-athlete may participate in organized team activities.**  
  
1. **Register online** using [this link to FamilyID.com](https://www.familyid.com/organizations/brookline-athletics)  
  
2\. Make sure your **physical exam is valid, on file, and moved to the current season** in the Athletic Dept. (Physicals expire 13 months from date of exam).  
  
3. **Submit payment** to BHS Athletics.  Athletics Fee is $300 per student, per season.  Fall 2020 payment will be due when rosters are finalized. **Online payment is currently not available but coming back soon.**  Checks may be made out to BHS Athletics and dropped off in the Athletic Dept. or mailed to Brookline High School, 115 Greenough St. Brookline, MA, 02445. Please write the student's name and sport on the check. Information regarding financial assistance may be [found at this link on the Public Schools of Brookline website](https://www.brookline.k12.ma.us/Page/2210).  
  
4\. Ensure that all **equipment** from previous seasons has been returned and **fees** have been paid.  
  
We work hard to ensure that everyone who completes all four steps is cleared to tryout within 24 hours; however, this is not guaranteed for registrations completed after the **fall deadline of September 21st.**  We set a deadline and close registration so that we are able to process the paperwork for the many students who complete their registrations on time.
