**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS- CARETAKERS**  
You will receive weekly updates from BHS Guidance each week, sent to all students, parent/guardians (listed as “1st contact” on Aspen), and also fully uploaded to the BHS Guidance website. After today’s update, any new information and events coming up in the next week will be highlighted in red for easier reading.  
   
**Save the date—Oct. 28 – for THE TRUTH ABOUT VAPING – UPDATED FOR FALL 2019**  
From nicotine addiction to life-threatening respiratory illness, the health risks of e-cigarettes (vapes, juuls) have been all over the news lately, and Brookline is not immune. In fact, vaping among our middle and high school students is on the rise. What do parents need to know? And what can we do to help our kids fully understand that these products are not harmless? Through the generosity of a Brookline community member in collaboration with PSB/ BHS Counseling-Guidance Department, Caron Treatment Centers will present a special informational parent event on October 28 at 7 p.m. in the Brookline High School Auditorium. Save the date! Please join us for this free presentation. Registration requested at [https://thetruthaboutvaping.eventbrite.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thetruthaboutvaping.eventbrite.com&sa=D&ust=1569589920787000&usg=AOvVaw0eFnaM99p24OQLDRkAduFn) 

  
**Encourage your child to be in touch with their guidance counselor.**    
With 9th grade students and staff at Old Lincoln, many 10th to 12th graders' guidance counselors and deans changed this year.  To find out who your student's guidance counselor is, log on to [Aspen](https://ma-brookline.myfollett.com/aspen/logon.do), click on "Family" tab and then on (one of) your student's name.  The middle column will list their 'administrator/dean and guidance counselor.  Most the counselors with students in Grades 10,11,12 have moved their offices to the new Counseling/Guidance HUB in Room 285. Kara Lopez (who also works with ACE students) will stay in her Room 248. Dan Bresman (SWS Counselor/ Program Director) is still in Room 400A. For more information on guidance and counseling support staff, contact info, and locations, see the attached PDF below.  
Our goal is to offer BHS students support as they develop into caring, resilient, capable, and academically balanced young adults during their high school years and beyond.  
   
The annual **Club/Activities Fair** happened last Thursday 9/12 in the Schluntz Gym during SuperX block. Many students joined in the organization, celebration, and introduction of over 100 clubs and extracurricular activities that exist at Brookline High. Never fear… If a student did not attend or wasn’t sure about signing up for any activities, a student can join most of these wonderful opportunities at any time throughout the school year. An updated list of activities with contact information will be published soon.  
   
**School Pictures/ ID** – Scheduled on September 24,25,26 out of students’ Social Studies classes.

Not sure if you should be taking the essay portion of the SAT or ACT? Most college admissions do NOT require the essay as part of their application process. Please read the link below from Compass Prep. Save yourself money and time by only taking the college admission testing you need for the colleges you are considering. As always, see your counselor or Lenny Libenzon, BHS College Counselor Room 279/280 if you have any questions.
