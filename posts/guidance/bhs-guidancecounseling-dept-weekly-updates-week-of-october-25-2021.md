		10/24/2021
	

Quarter 1 ends on 11/5. Many students (and staff) are finding this year to be more challenging academically, socially, and emotionally than expected due the shift from remote/hybrid learning to back in-person. School leaders, teachers, student support staff and students are actively discussing and working on how to manage the learning and community building of BHS in a productive, successful, and caring way for all.   
  
Please note that Monday November 1 will be a BHS Professional Development Day - NO SCHOOL FOR STUDENTS  
  
If a student has questions/concerns/or just wants to say hello to their counselor, please encourage your student to stop by their counselor’s office when not in class.  Gr 10-12 counselors are doing their best to support all of their students. Students should still contact their counselor for any questions or concerns – school related, post high school planning related, extracurricular activities related, or life related. If a counselor is not available when a student stops by their office, PLEASE leave a note or send an email. Counselors are nonstop with meetings in and out of their offices due to the significant number of BHS seniors now applying early to colleges for 11/1 and 11/15 deadlines. They are working closely with these students for advising and counselor recommendation writing. If a student issue is urgent, please indicate URGENT in the email heading. Thanks for your understanding! We’re here and ready to support EVERY BHS student!

**Registration for the 2022 AP exams-**  
**Students at Brookline High School will be registering online. Online Exam registration will begin on Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM and end on Mon, Nov 15, 2021 at 11:59 PM. Any student who signs up after this date, is charged a $40 late fee from the College Board.**  
**Many students are signing up on the College Board, but not signing up on Total Registration which is where they pay for the exams. STUDENTS MUST COMPLETE BOTH STEPS.**   
**The AP exam registration process has two steps, but both can be completed in one sitting when the student and parent/guardian do this together. Even if you do not plan to take the AP exam, you need to complete both steps to access the College Board’s AP resources. Both steps must be completed in order to have AP exams ordered:**  
**Step 1: Begin the process by registering at [www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/tQCNCDkJ8ruXOqYVi5yt5q?domain=user.totalregistration.net). Here you will indicate both the AP courses you are taking this year and the exams you wish to take. You will receive your join codes and directions to complete the second required step. Any exam fees will be paid online so be sure to have a debit card or credit card available before beginning registration. Paying online is a great way to make sure that payment has been made while avoiding mailing payment.**  
**Step 2: Use the join codes provided at the completion of step one to enroll the student's AP courses and exams in the College Board's system.**  
**This year each AP exam costs $105.00. Brookline High School would like to support every student in an AP class to take their AP exams. Students requiring financial assistance should contact Alexia Thomas, [alexia\_thomas@psbma.org](mailto:alexia_thomas@psbma.org), to learn more. If a student decides not to take an exam they must cancel their exam by November 15th, 2021 to get a full refund, students can get a partial refund if they cancel by March 15th, 2021.**   
**Here are the important dates for the registration process:**

*   **Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM - Registration Begins**
*   **Mon, Nov 15, 2021 at 11:59 PM - Registrations and payments after this date will incur a $40 late fee per exam.**
*   **Mon, Nov 8, 2021 at 11:59 PM - Registration Ends**
*   **Mon, Nov 15, 2021 - Registrations that have not been paid for will be cancelled and exams will not be ordered.**
*   **Mon, Nov 15, 2021 - Last day to cancel an exam and receive a full refund.**

**JUNIORS**  
**Introducing ….Thrive Scholars - This flagship college application support program admits students during their junior year of high school who meet the qualifications listed below.**  
**If admitted through their application process, this program supports admitted juniors as they apply to college and prepares them to pursue their career goals. Thrive Scholars offers a two-stage application process.  The Thrive Scholars application process includes several essay questions as well as academic and financial documents that you need to prepare. Please make sure you give yourself enough time to complete it.**  
   
**Thrive Scholars reviews applications holistically and does not have absolute requirements for admission. However, students who are accepted into the program typically meet the following criteria: currently enrolled as a junior in high school, have SAT or PSAT score of 1200+ / ACT or Pre-ACT score of 25+ (\*if available- In response to the global pandemic and its continuing impact on student access to standardized tests, Thrive Scholars is reviewing applications with a test-optional policy. Since many students will not have test scores to report, we will focus more on a student’s grades and academic rigor within the context of what their school offers (AP, IB, Dual Enrollment, etc.), identify as one of the following- a first-generation college student and/or a student of color.**  
**Planning ahead? College Admissions Test Dates at BHS for this school year - see the attached document. More info about college admissions testing will be presented at this Thurs 10/28 zoom presentation. See below.**

**9TH GRADERS**   
**The 9th grade counseling team continues to host a Social Lunch for 9th grade students who might benefit from having a quieter place to eat lunch, especially our students who have had a more difficult time finding social connections during lunch! Students should come by the OLS Main Office during any Wednesday lunch period. Thanks to the counselor team for offering this important opportunity!**
