                      <li><strong>Junior Assembly with Lenny Libenzon and counselors on Dec 12 advisory – REQUIRED for all juniors to attend</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Junior Seminar Round 1 will happen through January/early Feb in advisories</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Junior Seminar Round 2 will happen in March during MCAS mornings. More details on times/dates to come soon!</strong></li>
                    </ul> &nbsp;<br><strong>PSAT results </strong>will likely be available online via the College Board website approximately during the week of Dec 9, 2019. Students who took this practice test should be receiving an email from the College Board to announce that scores are available and to provide directions for access.&nbsp;College Board accounts should have been created by students, so we have no way of knowing their username/passwords. If a student cannot access their account, they should try the "forgot the password" feature first. If that doesn't work, Lenny Libenzon can help students with access when they drop by College-Career Center 279 or his office 280. Last year, issues arose when a student's parents used their own emails to create the account.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Add this event to your calendar - Junior Year Timeline and Standardized College Admissions Testing presentation – </strong>Thursday, December 12, 2019 from 6:30-8:30 pm, in the BHS Auditorium. Lenny Libenzon, the BHS College Counselor in the Counseling/Guidance Department will go over the Junior Year Post High School Planning Timeline and Drew Heilpern from Summit Educational Group will talk about the different types of standardized tests that our juniors/seniors take (SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT, AP). This night is open to junior and sophomore students and their parents/caregivers. Please note that BHS does not specifically promote any outside testing prep companies, but appreciates their information sharing for this event.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>FRESHMEN</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>9th grade counselors will be joining HUBs starting this pre-Thanksgiving week for CTO (Counselors Take Over!) to offer circles on “</strong><strong>Showing Gratitude and Appreciation Circle”</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We encourage all 9th grade students to meet their assigned guidance counselor. Please encourage your 9th grader to stop by their counselor’s office between classes or during HUB or X block if needed. Students can also email their counselor to set up a meeting time -<strong> <a href="mailto:CounselorFirstName_LastName@psbma.org">CounselorFirstName_LastName@psbma.org</a></strong><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>
