**All students are encouraged to check in with your counselor about course selection questions. Email your counselor to make an appointment. Keep in mind BALANCE as you think about your course selection for next year – including demands of class work, extracurriculars, sports, theater, community service, job, sleep and relaxation time!**

**Summer 2018 program planning resources**  
**THINKING SUMMER?**  Thank you Episcopal High School, TX website for this introduction regarding Summer Plans!  
  
_“We encourage students to use their summers wisely. This can mean doing_  
_anything from an academic program to community service to a good old fashioned_  
_job. Below we have listed a number of summer opportunities \[and_  
_websites with summer resources\] of varying content, location, length of time,_  
_and cost. Some programs are free, while others cost thousands of dollars;_  
_most fall somewhere in between. Please know that the cost of a program is_  
_not a measure of its quality or prestige in the eyes of college admission_  
_offices. This list is just a starting point to get you thinking. There are many_  
_more programs out there, so feel free to explore!”_  
_BHS Guidance has added to the list below. By listing the programs below, we do_  
_not endorse but simply mention as ideas to get students thinking about_  
_interesting summer options. We strongly recommend students consider local_  
_employment options (see Kate Cordner, the BHS Career Counselor in Room_  
_280/279, or stop by the College-Career Center Jobs board outside 279). Also local_  
_community service can be a great way to give back to your community while_  
_gaining valuable experience in the greater Brookline area._  
_Enjoying and relaxing during the summer is also important for balance in busy_  
_high school students’ lives!_
