​**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS- CARETAKERS**  
Welcome to the 2019-20 school year from the BHS/OLS Counseling/Guidance Department!  
You will receive weekly updates from BHS Guidance each week, sent to all students, parent/guardians (listed as “1st contact” on Aspen), and also fully uploaded to the BHS Guidance website. After today’s update, any new information and events coming up in the next week will be highlighted in red for easier reading.  
   
**Encourage your child to be in touch with their guidance counselor.**    
With 9th grade students and staff at Old Lincoln, many 10th to 12th graders' guidance counselors and deans changed this year.  To find out who your student's guidance counselor is, log on to [Aspen](https://ma-brookline.myfollett.com/aspen/logon.do), click on "Family" tab and then on (one of) your student's name.  The middle column will list their 'administrator/dean and guidance counselor.  Most the counselors with students in Grades 10,11,12 have moved their offices to the new Counseling/Guidance HUB in Room 285. Kara Lopez (who also works with ACE students) will stay in her Room 248. Dan Bresman (SWS Counselor/ Program Director) is still in Room 400A. For more information on guidance and counseling support staff, contact info, and locations, see the attached PDF below.  
Our goal is to offer BHS students support as they develop into caring, resilient, capable, and academically balanced young adults during their high school years and beyond.

The annual **Club/Activities Fair** happened last Thursday 9/12 in the Schluntz Gym during SuperX block. Many students joined in the organization, celebration, and introduction of over 100 clubs and extracurricular activities that exist at Brookline High. Never fear… If a student did not attend or wasn’t sure about signing up for any activities, a student can join most of these wonderful opportunities at any time throughout the school year. An updated list of activities with contact information will be published soon.  
**School Pictures/ ID** – Scheduled on September 24,25,26 out of one class. More details to follow…..  
   
**SENIORS**  
   
**Welcome to Senior Year!** We look forward to supporting you in your planning for life after BHS. It is important that you attend ALL required senior events – including tomorrow’s Senior Assembly and upcoming Senior Seminars, starting the week of 9/23 out of one free block and again the same free block during the week of October 1.  
   
The BHS Guidance/Counseling Department invites all parents of seniors (and Grade 12 students who missed the 9/16 student assembly) to the **"Post High School Planning" presentation this Tuesday 9/17 at 6:30pm, in the Roberts Dubbs Auditorium.**  
An overview of the resources in place to support all BHS seniors will be discussed. BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon will present an overview of post high school planning, with particular focus on the "nuts and bolts" of applying to college from BHS. Topics will include: "releasing" transcripts from BHS, Early Action and Early Decision, college essay tips, and more. He will answer your college-related questions during the presentation.  
Expect to leave the night a lot less stressed about the college process!  
A similar presentation is given to all seniors on 9/16 - to download powerpoint slides, go to the BHS Guidance Webpage ([http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance)).  
We look forward to seeing you Tuesday evening!  
   
   
**Transcript release / Teacher-Counselor Recommendation Deadlines**   
To best support every senior in their college admissions process, we require that all seniors meet the deadlines below for communicating to both teacher and counselors re: recommendations. Seniors will learn more at tomorrow’s required Senior Assembly during Advisory and parents/guardians can learn more at the Tuesday evening PTO/Guidance event mentioned above.

**JUNIORS**  
   
**The Junior Parent Guidance Meet and Greet is scheduled for this TUES 9/17, 8:30-9:30 AM, MLK room.** This is an informal opportunity for parents of juniors to have time to introduce (or re-introduce) themselves to their junior student's counselor while enjoying some coffee and muffins. Please stop by to say hello. Two important notes:  
\--  any need for more detailed conversations with counselors should be scheduled for another time  
\-- post high school planning, including college planning, conversations with juniors will start in December 2019/January 2020 after PSAT scores are communicated  
The BHS Counseling/Guidance department looks forward to working as a team with your junior and you!  
   
**The PSATs are coming to BHS**…. We are excited to again offer the PSAT – practice for the College Board SAT college admissions test – to all juniors on Saturday, October 19.  Information will be shared during Monday 9/23 Advisory and online registration will begin on Tuesday 9/24 and end Wednesday 10/9. More details to come in the weekly Guidance Update next week.  
   
​​**SOPHOMORES**  
   
**Welcome back to Brookline High!** Hopefully you’ve had a chance to say hello to your counselor (old or new!) during last week’s advisories or in their office. We want to get to know you, so please make the effort to come by to say hello. We’re here to help with schedules, concerns, questions, and eventually supporting you in your post high school plan.  
   
**FRESHMEN**  
   
**Welcome to Brookline High School!**  
9th grade students have been introduced to their assigned guidance counselor in the first week of school during advisories. Counselors are excited to continue getting to now their students by visiting HUB communities frequently, as well as presenting guidance seminars during HUB starting in October. You can contact your student’s counselor at the following numbers and please encourage your 9th grader to stop by their counselor’s office between classes or during HUB or X block if needed. Students can also email their counselor to set up a meeting time - **[CounselorFirstName\_LastName@psbma.org](mailto:CounselorFirstName_LastName@psbma.org)**  
   
NOTE - Students assigned to Ms Sara Aggeler should be contacting Mr Larry Allen ([larry\_allen@psbma.org](mailto:larry_allen@psbma.org)) while she is out for maternity leave. Thank you!
