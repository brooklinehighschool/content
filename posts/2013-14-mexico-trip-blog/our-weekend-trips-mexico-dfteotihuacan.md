**This weekend was very exciting!! We left Cuernavaca on Saturday at 9:00 AM. and drove to Mexico City where we visited two excellent museums. On Sunday, we traveled to the Teotihuacan ruins and stayed there until 5:00 PM. The group is enjoying  this trip very much.**

**_Dolores Olmedo Museum- Mexico D.F_  
When we first arrived at the Dolores Olmedo Museum we spent some time walking outside near the gardens. The grounds were beautiful, there were many exotic flowers and wildlife. To our surprise there were peacocks roaming freely around the grounds. We then went inside the museum and observed the paintings of Diego Rivera. His portraits of women were breathtaking. We also saw some of Orozco's sketches, which represented the problems he saw in the Mexican society. Another great exhibit had colorful pottery from previous civilizations in Mexico. After visiting the museum we had a better understanding, appreciation, and love for Mexican culture

**Frida Kahlo's House**  
**The second stop on our Saturday excursion was Frida Kahlo's house: _La Casa Azul_. Her house is rightfully named as "The Blue House" because of the cobalt blue walls that make up her house. Not only was the garden in the center of her house beautiful, but the exhibit inside of her house was incredible. Moving through the house we saw various paintings, pictures, works by her husband, Diego Rivera, her workspace, and her room. This stop was a nice addition to the Spanish Art History we studied in our classes last year, and fulfilled all of my hopes I had for the experience of being in her house.

**_Teotihuacán_  
The sun beat down on us as we walked into the site of the Teotihuacán pyramids. We first saw the remains of the temple for Quetzalcoatl, an important Aztec god. Afterward, some of us climbed the Piramide del Sol, the tallest of the two pyramids there, while others climbed the other pyramid, the Piramide de la Luna, or bought souvenirs from the many vendors that lined the Camino de la Muerte, the main road. Finally, we enjoyed a 2-course dinner at Piramide Charlie's accompanied by some time on a nearby playground. Yes, we are very mature!!

﻿﻿**Myra's Poem**﻿﻿  
  
  
**Bienvenidos a Cuernevaca!- Dia Uno  
  
             Por Myra Johnson  
  
    On our first day,   
we arrived quite early,  
Can we rest?   
our teachers replied ‘surely!’  
But little did we know  
that on our first day,  
We would not be able  
to enjoy our stay  
Instead we were to climb  
a very ‘small’ hill  
Which we were taken to  
against our will.  
‘Really,   
  
  it’s hardly a climb’  
‘I promise,  
I tell you,  
It won’t take much time’  
Two hours later,  
we found this not to be true,  
and seriously considered executing a coup’.  
  
    After it all,   
we decided it was for the best,  
to simply enjoy the view,  
and then get some rest.  
  
    While climbing down the mountain,  
some of us slipped,   
while other felt quite confident…  
until they first tripped.  
By the end of the day,  
we were all really quite pooped,  
for that huge mountain,  
we had just trooped.  
It had only been   
but 12 hours since we had got here  
although it felt as if   
we’d been for a year.  
  
    Day 1 down,  
13 to go,  
and we are all quite glad   
to be avoiding the snow.  
We hope the weather,  
is not too bad in Brookline,  
and that everyone back home   
is doing just fine.**
