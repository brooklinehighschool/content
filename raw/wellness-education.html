  <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">Our Program</h2>
  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;">The Brookline High School Health and Fitness Program is designed to teach students content and skills, allowing them to be healthy and active throughout life. Students learn current health content and related personal skills, including goal setting, in order to make positive decisions around health and wellness issues. Further learning experiences are offered in the development and function of the human body, the principles of human movement,, the application of health and fitness concepts in daily life, as well as communication, decision-making, and media literacy skills. Class work often focuses on the development of confidence in physical skills in a variety of lifetime activities. Another focal point involves group dynamics with students learning to work together in small and large group situations. Emphasis is also placed on the acceptance and appreciation of the range of individual abilities among students.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span> In the ninth grade, all students are required to pass one semester of Integrated Health and Fitness. This course is designed to make the health and fitness curricular connections more meaningful. The course will meet four times per week for one semester. In the classroom, students are encouraged to listen to others, express their own views, and examine their health and wellness decisions. Physical activities and training often serve as the "lab session" for related health needs. The 10th, 11th and 12th grade courses are designed to provide students with a selection of lifetime activities and health related opportunities on a semester basis.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span> After School Contract Health and Fitness is offered to sophomores, juniors and seniors who take instruction off campus in a lifetime activity that is not offered at the high school. Final grade (P or F) is contingent upon fulfillment of all contract responsibilities. Sports Team credit is offered to sophomores, juniors and seniors who choose to fulfill their requirement with a BHS interscholastic sport. One sport equals one semester of Health and Fitness. Final grade (P or F) is contingent upon completing the season in good standing. See the course descriptions for more complete details.<br><a href="/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/2013__health_fitness_options_.ppt" title="">Health and Fitness Options</a><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span></div>
