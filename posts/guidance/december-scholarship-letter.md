​Dear Seniors, Juniors and their Parents/Guardians,  
  
Some of our students have received either Koplik or Adams Scholarship letters in the past weeks.  These awards cover tuition at Massachusetts State Schools.  Please note that the “tuition” part of cost of attendance is just a fraction of the overall cost, so the typical award is somewhere around $1,500.  The two scholarships have different [requirements](https://www.doe.mass.edu/scholarships/mastery/Koplik-Adams-compare.html). Please pay special attention if your student received the Koplik certificate. In order to receive the scholarship, he or she will need to [demonstrate proficiency by taking an AP or SAT Subject Test exams](https://www.doe.mass.edu/scholarships/mastery/) (additional details on the back of the scholarship letter).  
  
While doing scholarship searches with my own son, I’ve been very impressed with [GoingMerry.com](https://www.goingmerry.com/). It is a free service that aggregates scholarships and then emails you when a batch of scholarships are due. For example, Nick  just got a notice that ten scholarships that could match his profile are due in December. I can now annoy him by constantly reminding him to submit the application. ​

[Free Application for Federal Student Aid](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) has been open since October 1st, and I’ve been fielding questions about it.  Please make sure you choose the correct year when filling out the form. It is currently available to applicants starting in Spring 2021 and in the Fall 2021. Current seniors starting in the fall will need the 2021/2022 application.  After the application is completed, you can submit it to 10 schools.  Once you get the SAR back (3-5 days), you can go back to FAFSA, remove the first batch of schools and add another 10 schools.  
Below are some examples of outside scholarships that are available to our students:  
My name is Calvin Rosser, and I’m the CEO of Life Reimagined Ventures, a company dedicated to empowering 10 million people to live a more fulfilling life. Each year, we award $500 in scholarships to high-achieving, high school students who have been affected in some way by the increasing prevalence of mental health challenges.  The scholarship is designed to inspire greater awareness about mental health and fuel innovative solutions that help the millions of people who are suffering  [https://calvinrosser.com/scholarships/mental-health-awareness](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/_eG2COY58kuwN5jzuvO24X?domain=calvinrosser.com)  
[The RevenueZen Social Selling Scholarship](https://get.revenuezen.com/social-selling-scholarship) is an award for any current or soon-to-be undergrad who is looking to innovate the hiring process. In an ideal world, what would hiring and applying for a job look like? How will you stand out? The RevenueZen Scholarship has a brief submission process, and applicants will be judged on their ability to convey their idea for an innovative social selling process focused on getting hired at a specific company.   
Hello Mr Libenzon, I wanted to mention that we are in the middle of our Army ROTC High School National Scholarship process.  The second board submission deadline will be in early January and the third will be in March.  There is plenty of time for students to meet the deadline for both boards. Contact: [Scott T. Lyons](mailto:sc.lyons@northeastern.edu), Enrollment and Scholarship Officer, Northeastern U (617) 373-2376   
[Applications are now being accepted for the KPMG Future Leaders Program](https://womensleadership.kpmg.us/charitable/developing-future-generations-women-leaders1.html) – Class of 2021! KPMG Future Leaders Program will award 22 deserving female high school seniors with a scholarship of $10,000 per year. Applicant criteria includes: Proven track record of academic excellence and leadership potential, Minimum 3.5 cumulative GPA, Interest in a business or STEM academic track, Demonstrates a significant financial need, Letter of recommendation from a nonprofit.  
Thank you,
