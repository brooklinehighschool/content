Just stopping by to say thanks and let them know where you stand with admissions or writing a quick note makes a BIG difference to those who helped you!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Early Decision acceptances - please contact all colleges also applied to for EA/RD and remove your name from their lists...and congrats!</strong><br><br>As College Counselor Tara Anne Dowling suggests-<br>“Say 'Thank you' as well as 'No, thank you'&nbsp;<br>--‘Thank you for taking time with my credentials’, ‘thank you for answering my questions’, ‘thank you for offering me a scholarship’ etc.<br>--‘No, thank you, I will be attending another college’ (you can say the name of your attending college if you feel comfortable)<br>This is done in myriad ways:<br>* via the online portal they may give you the option to decline your offer and say where you are going<br>* via email to the rep who has been working with you<br>* via post--did you get a big packet in the mail? There may be a postcard that asks for you to respond with info if you are declining the offer<br>What is goodwill and why does it matter?<br>--Admission officers very often become invested in the students they are reviewing. They have read your file, recommended you to the admission committee, and perhaps put you up for a scholarship. Hard work deserves a big thank you.<br>--You never know if you may need to transfer<br>--You may have a younger sibling or friend who will attend this university. How can a good relationship that helps other people be a bad thing?<br>What's in it for me?<br>--If good will doesn't move you (or good manners!) then think of kids on waitlists who are dying to find out if they can have that place that is currently being held by you. You can help colleges clean up their records and make room for other candidates!"<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Transcript release / Teacher-Counselor Recommendation Deadlines </strong><br><strong>Upcoming due dates:</strong><br><u>College deadline</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>BHS Deadline</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>February 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday, January 6<br>February 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday, January 17<br>&nbsp;<br>Yearbook deadlines - Seniors can find the information below and other updates on the Class of 2020 canvas page-<br>Senior Picture deadline was FRIDAY DECEMBER 20th.
