Contact your counselor at their email, zoom visiting hours, or phone.

Thinking of changing sending an ACT or SAT test score after you’ve applied test optional?   
BHS Counselors are advising students to call each school that they are applying to ask how to manage shifting from test optional to sending scores because there does not seem to be common practice in admissions offices.   
  
  
  
SENIORS – READ YOUR EMAILS!   
ALSO BE SURE TO FOLLOW ANY APPLICANT PORTAL DIRECTIONS for colleges you will be applying to, if they have a portal protocol. Your efficiency in opening up these accounts after applying is sometimes monitored by admissions offices to gauge your level of interest!  
  
MEFA financial aid events will all be online this fall.  BHS Guidance partners with the Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (MEFA) each year to provide families with a wealth of financial aid information. This year, due to the global pandemic, MEFA will not be sending their speakers out to high schools. Please visit [https://www.mefa.org/events](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/-O6zCo26yKuBRLQqi1dF7y?domain=mefa.org) to investigate upcoming webinars and take a look at their very informative website.   
  
  
College Application Reminders:  
  
Help the BHS counselors and teachers support your application process by meeting these deadlines. Submit your electronic transcript release forms, your self-questionnaire, your parent/caregiver’s “brag” sheet, and give notice to your teachers who have agreed to write recommendations for you.  
If you have college application deadlines for 12/15 and 1/1/21 you have not yet completed a transcript release request, please do this step and contact your counselor immediately to confirm. Also connect with your teachers regarding recommendations since you are behind in informing these critical BHS staff people who want to do their best to support your college application process.  
  
College Deadline                     BHS Deadline  
January 15                        Wednesday December 9  
February 1                         Wednesday January 6  
February 15                        Friday January 15  
  
Seniors – When submitting your transcript release forms electronically, please:

*   use the updated link shared by your counselor (on their CANVAS page or by email)
*   be sure to list your college names and addresses CORRECTLY AS THEY APPEAR OFFICIALLY ON THE COLLEGE’S WEBSITE OR NAVIANCE. The processing of your request is slowed down by not including the official name of the college or putting in wrong information.  
      
      
    

  
JUNIORS  
  
PSAT scores will be shared on the College Board website this Tues 12/8. Creating a College Board account will allow juniors to easily access their scores online and unlock a robust set of personalized resources to help them understand their scores.
