The PSAT/NMSQT (Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test) will be administered at **Brookline High School on the morning of Saturday, October** **14th from 7:45- 12:15 pm.**  
The PSAT/NMSQT measures critical reading skills, math problem-solving skills and writing skills. Brookline High School recommends that juniors take the PSAT/NMSQT in order to receive feedback about strengths and weaknesses in verbal and mathematical abilities and be able to compare their performance with that of thousands of juniors across the country who also take the test. The PSAT helps prepare students for the SAT later on in their school experience.   Lastly, juniors are also automatically entered into the National Merit Scholarship competition.  
For the 2017 PSAT/NMSQT, students at Brookline High School will be registering online.  This registration will take a few minutes and can be completed from any computer with internet access. Here is the link: [www.TotalRegistration.net/PSAT/220445](http://www.totalregistration.net/PSAT/220445)  
Brookline High School is excited to offer families the convenience of paying exam fees online at the time of registration. The cost to take the PSAT is $20.  Please be sure to have a **debit or credit card available before beginning registration**. Paying online is a great way to make sure that payment has been made while avoiding mailing payment.   As a junior, if you feel you qualify for a fee waiver, please indicate that on the online form or see your counselor or Ms. Castellano in the Main Guidance office.  
Here are the important dates for the registration process:  
·      Fri, Sep 15, 2017 at 8:00 AM - Registration Begins  
·      Wed, Oct 4, 2017 at 11:59 PM - Registration Ends  
·      Sat, Oct 7, 2017 at 11:59 AM - Registrations that have not been paid for will be canceled and exams will not be ordered.  
Free PSAT practice questions will be emailed to you after registration.  In addition, you can sign up for a free PSAT practice test offered by Kaplan here at BHS on Tuesday, Sept 26 from 3-6:20 pm. You must register- go to [bit.ly/brookline2017](http://bit.ly/brookline2017). This information plus another Kaplan online practice opportunity will be sent to your Naviance email address as well.  
On Saturday, 10/14 - please report to BHS by 7:45 am. Bring #2 pencils, a calculator, and PHOTO IDENTIFICATION.  _You will not be admitted to the exam without an ID._
