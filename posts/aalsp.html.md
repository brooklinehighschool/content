The African American and Latino Scholars Program (AALSP) is a unique seminar for underrepresented minority students at Brookline High School. The program aims to promote the success of academically talented African American and Hispanic/Latino students all the while aiding in the positive growth of the student as an academic, minority, and person. The program has proved extremely successful, helping large amounts of underrepresented students reach their goals of academic achievement, and providing preparation for college and beyond.
