Our Program
-----------

Brookline High typically offers two levels of Rugby, varsity and junior varsity.  But don’t make the mistake of saying that to a “rugger.”  He/she will refer to the two teams as the A and the B sides.  The season is a short one, taking place over about 8 weeks in the spring.  During the week, athletes will meet 4 days: once for a weight training session, twice for on field practice at Skyline park, and once for a game.  Practice over the April vacation is optional.  Attendance for all other meetings however is mandatory, unless prior approval from the coaching staff was granted.   
  
No experience is required and we welcome athletes of all levels.  There are absolutely no cuts.   
  
From the staff to the players, we hope to see you “lace up the boots” with our family.
