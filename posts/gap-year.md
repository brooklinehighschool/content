Gap Year  

-----------

Gap Year is an increasingly popular option with BHS students. Most of the students interested in Gap Year choose to apply to college during their senior year and then defer for a year in order to engage in their Gap Year program.  BHS Guidance Department is proud to offer Gap Year Fair in winter.  Below are some of the resources to consider while researching your Gap Year programs.  Please contact Lenny Libenzon, BHS College Counselor, if you have any questions.
