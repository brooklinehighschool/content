Our Program
-----------

**Philosophy**  
The Brookline Track & Field program is dedicated to making each athlete the best athlete they can be. This is done within the context of a team philosophy with athletes training together to reach both individual and team goals. The coaches establish training plans for team members to follow. We encourage input from athletes in determining individual and team goals. The coaches attempt to establish a challenging and supportive enviroment for the team so athletes can excel. We encourage athletes of all abilities; from first time participants to national caliber athletes to do “their” best. As such it is the responsibility of each athlete to make a commitment to doing the best that they can.  A high level of dedication is expected of all athletes regardless of skill level. The benefits of the program come from the lessons of hard work in the struggle to achieve goals; not just in the achievements themselves. We therefore look to provide opportunities to athletes of all abilities. Along with our Bay State Conference schedule, there are also Junior Varsity meets and invitational meets for athletes to test their abilites. It is the goal of the program to have each athlete progress throughout the season. With this philosophy we hope to encourage both team and individual success.   
  
**Season**  
The season begins the third Monday of March. All athletes must have clearance paperwork on file with the athletic office before participating. The season runs to the last week of May for all athletes. Varsity athletes will continue on based on qualifying standards.   
  
**Practice**  
The team practices or competes six days a week. The team practices each day after school at Downes Field beginning at 3:15 to approximately 5:30.  Saturday practices are held for about two hours in the morning.  We sometimes have invitational meets on Saturdays that run most of the day.   
  
**Expectations & Commitment**  
All athletes are expected to be at practice daily unless excused. Justifiable reasons to be excused are illness, family emergency, religious purposes and standardized testing.  Athletes must notify a coach if they have a reason to be excused from practice. Athletes of all abilities are expected to be committed to doing their best and that begins with maximum effort at practice. Athletes that have 3 unexcused abscences may be dismissed from the team.
