Hi All! This is the Jen, the Program Director of the fellowship.  I wanted to offer an update on what we've been up to this fall.  This year, the fellowship will be offering opportunities for BHS students to work on their writing during the school year.  We are launching 2 new writing initiatives.  First, we will be hosting a BHS Moth Story hour on the topic of "Navigating Uncertainty." This event will celebrate the art of writing a great story and how to deliver that story in a powerful way.  Details are on our main page! We are also working on a winter opinion editorial writing workshop that will give 10 students a focused time to write about something that matters to them and publishing their work in the Sagamore and other publications. This workshop will run during Feb. break.  More details on that in the near future.  If you have any questions about the fellowship or these other opportunities feel free to reach to me via email at jen\_martin@psbma.org.
