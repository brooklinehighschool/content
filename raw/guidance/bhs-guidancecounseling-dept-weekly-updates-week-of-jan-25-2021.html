IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO READ YOUR EMAILS (FROM COLLEGES AND BHS)!&nbsp;</strong> <strong>ALSO BE SURE TO FOLLOW ANY APPLICANT PORTAL DIRECTIONS for colleges you will be applying to, if they have a portal protocol. Your efficiency in opening up these accounts after applying is sometimes monitored by admissions offices to gauge your level of interest!</strong><br><strong>Reminder - ALL SENIORS MUST EARN WELLNESS CREDIT TO GRADUATE. Spring athlete Seniors who are NOT playing their sport should be scheduled in a Wellness Class now for Semester 2.&nbsp; Depending on the ongoing status of the current Winter sports team situation, the Wellness department will work on next steps about the impact of wellness credits for graduation.</strong> Stay tuned… <strong>With so many seniors remote, we understand that many have decided not to participate on a sports team this year. Seniors are responsible to be in touch with their counselor and make arrangements to earn their final wellness credit to graduate from BHS.</strong><br><strong>“As you look back on your life, you realize that every time you thought you were being rejected from something good, you were actually being redirected to something better.”</strong><br><strong>Were you deferred from a college that you are still interested in being considered? </strong>See BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon’s What to Do if you are Deferred or Waitlisted info sheet – see attached. <strong>If you need any guidance, please reach out to your counselor or BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon.</strong><br><strong>Thinking about a post grad path that is NOT college specific? Check in with your counselor and/or Kate Kennedy, the BHS Career Counselor, for ideas and resources.</strong>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>College Application Reminders:</strong><br><strong>Help the BHS counselors and teachers support your application process by meeting these deadlines. Submit your electronic transcript release forms, your self-questionnaire, your parent/caregiver’s “brag” sheet, and give notice to your teachers who have agreed to write recommendations for you.</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Seniors – When submitting your transcript release forms electronically, please:</strong><br>· <strong>use the updated link shared by your counselor (on their CANVAS page or by email)</strong><br>· <strong>be sure to list your college names and addresses CORRECTLY AS THEY APPEAR OFFICIALLY ON THE COLLEGE’S WEBSITE OR NAVIANCE. The processing of your request is slowed down by not including the official name of the college or putting in wrong information.</strong><br><br><br><strong>JUNIORS and SENIORS</strong><br><strong>Are you a junior or senior (or parent/guardian of a junior or senior) with diagnosed learning differences? Want to gain understanding about how student support and accommodations are handled differently in college than high school? </strong>BHS Guidance and Special Education will come together to share a great panel on this topic in March&nbsp; (details TBD). We have also gotten information about an good overview presentation on this topic from Westfield State College. Here are more details below plus please see the attached flyer for registration to one of these presentations still happening from Jan 25-27:<br>Preparing for college is process. It includes learning how to be an independent learner, advocate for one self and how to improve your academic skills continuously. Students with disabilities going to college should understand that they will be expected to perform – and will be assessed – in the same manner as their peers. There are other considerations, among them are:<br>&nbsp;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sorts of reasonable accommodations are available?<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I request reasonable accommodations?<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sort of documentation do I need to receive accommodations?<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why doesn’t my IEP or 504 plan follow me to college?<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What steps can I take now to be college ready?<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the level of parents’ involvement in college?<br>&nbsp;<br><u>Westfield State University’s</u>&nbsp;<u>Banacos Academic Center</u>&nbsp;is hosting hour-long Zoom sessions to address these very questions for high school students and their parents or guardians.&nbsp; Disability/Accessibility Services staff from the other Massachusetts Universities and a&nbsp;<u>Westfield State Admissions</u>&nbsp;representative will be present.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;<u>use this form to sign up</u>&nbsp;for a session.
