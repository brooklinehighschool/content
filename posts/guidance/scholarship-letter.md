​​**BHS Scholarships**   
   
The Brookline High School Scholarship Committee announces that applications are now available for BHS scholarships for students going to ANY college. Applications are available online at the BHS homepage. Applications must be completed ASAP. The Scholarship Committee would like parents to know that we use three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, unmet financial need. There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code #0424   
   
Below is a listing of scholarships available to qualified BHS Grade 12 students. You can find many more scholarships on fastweb.com and the search engines listed below:
