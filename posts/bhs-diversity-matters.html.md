BHS Diversity Matters

School Vision
-------------

Welcome to the BHS Diversity Matters webpage. BHS community members recently suggested a webpage to collect information, actions, resources, and updates on the important work the BHS community is engaged in about anti-racism and diversity.  Students can also offer feedback, ideas, suggestions and also report concerns on the "Feedback/Suggestions" link below.  This webpage is a work-in-progress.  So is our work to counter institutional racism.  We know that we are doing some things right, and we know we are getting some things wrong.  Our goal is to continue to build community around all our challenges.  BHS has always been at its best when it creates healthy and open collaboration with students and faculty about ways to solve problems.  Our students are pushing faculty and leadership to think, act, feel, and learn with them. We support their activism and note that it is squarely in line with BHS' history and tradition of being an early national model of a democratic high school, where students drive school change.

Teach BHS
---------

Over the next five years, Brookline High's population will increase from 1950 to 2300.  We are actively seeking a racially diverse pool of applicants for these new positions.  We understand how critical it is to make sure our staff reflects the diversity of our student body.  We are currently hosting visits for interested candidates, as well we are attending diversity hiring fairs, and hosting BHS open house events.

Learning
--------

School-wide continuous learning about anti-racism, anti-bias, and privilege is how we will  serve all students better.  We seek to widen the menu of opportunities for learning for both students and faculty.  Here are a few things we are reading and learning:

Books faculty are reading school-wide (faculty and faculty with students) or in reading groups:
