​It’s October and that means it’s Mental Health Awareness month. I read this on my social media page and it hit home to me, so I share with you:  
**What is Love? by Emma K, age 6 – “Love is when you’re missing some of your teeth but you’re not afraid to smile because you know your friends will still love you even though some of you is missing.”**  
**Kindness, grace and compassion matter. This is THE most important!**  
  
These BHS Counseling Dept Weekly Update emails are sent to all students and the 1st contact parent/guardian listed on the students’ X2 accounts.  
  
If a student has questions/concerns/or just wants to say hello to their counselor, please encourage your student to stop by their counselor’s office when not in class.  
  
We’re here and ready to support EVERY BHS student!

  
  
All NEW UPDATES will be highlighted in BLUE each week for easy scanning of newest info.

Student Directors of the **Brookline Tutor Mentor Program (BTMP)** are looking for tutors. The BTMP was founded in 2014 with the goal of connecting high-schoolers and middle schoolers both through academics and a supportive mentor system. We individually pair middle school students and high-achieving high school tutors based on students’ academic needs and interests. We aim to offer a tutor and a role model for kids who are struggling academically, need an extra challenge, or just want a friend. The Brookline Tutor Mentor Program is looking to recruit high schoolers to tutor and guide middle school kids. Being a tutor-mentor is one of the most fulfilling positions in the community. Not only will you receive community service hours and a good addition to your resume, but as a high school student, tutoring gives you an opportunity to truly engage with and support a middle school student. Whether they are struggling with school or need advice from a friendly face, the tutor-mentor program is their rock that can be relied on at any time. As role models, our job is to motivate young students and aid them in growing into mature young adults. Students and their mentors often create deep bonds that transcend age differences and continue even beyond the Tutor-Mentor Program.  
Please note: This year, the BTMP schedule is completely remote for the time being due to COVID-19. Because of this, tutoring hours are flexible! Tutors will be offered a large selection of times to meet with their students. If you apply, please regularly check your email for updates on meeting times, etc. If you are interested in giving back, earning community service hours, and adding something meaningful and unique to your resume, apply at https://bit.ly/BTMPTutorApplication. Please email btm@brooklineteencenter.org if you have any questions!  
  
  
**SENIORS**  
   
**SENIORS FILLING OUT THE BHS TRANSCRIPT REQUEST FORMS** – Please be sure to add complete college addresses on this form (not just use zip codes). With so many colleges having multiple campuses, it is sometimes impossible to know which location you are applying. Not doing this step completely holds up your paperwork processing on our end. Thank you!  
  
  
**BHS Guide to Applying to Colleges** is a good introduction to the nuts and bolts of applying to college from BHS. Document also attached to this email.  
  
**Counselors of seniors continue to join senior advisories through early October** to share senior’s unofficial transcripts for review plus continue information sharing and support regarding the post high school planning process.

They come specifically to talk to you and answer your questions. It is a great opportunity for you to connect to colleges without traveling! This year, the visits will be virtual, and after school (starting at 4 pm). You will need to sign up for visits through Naviance (https://student.naviance.com/colleges/visits). Please take a look at this list and sign up. If you need help logging in to Naviance, email Lenny Libenzon or your counselor. Seniors can attend any and all college sessions of schools they plan to or are interested in attending. The schedule and REQUIRED zoom link registration can be found on your Naviance homepage. This is a wonderful way to learn more about colleges, ask important questions, and show demonstrated interest!

**Registration for the 2022 AP exams-**  
Students at Brookline High School will be registering online. Online Exam registration will begin on Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM and end on Mon, Nov 8, 2021 at 11:59 PM. The AP exam registration process has two steps, but both can be completed in one sitting when the student and parent/guardian do this together. **Even if you do not plan to take the AP exam, you need to complete both steps to access the College Board’s AP resources**. Both steps must be completed in order to have AP exams ordered:  
**Step 1:** Begin the process by registering at www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445. Here you will indicate both the AP courses you are taking this year and the exams you wish to take. You will receive your join codes and directions to complete the second required step. Any exam fees will be paid online so be sure to have a **debit card or credit card available before beginning registration**. Paying online is a great way to make sure that payment has been made while avoiding mailing payment.  
**Step 2:** Use the join codes provided at the completion of step one to enroll the student's AP courses and exams in the College Board's system.  
This year each AP exam costs $105.00. Brookline High School would like to support every student in an AP class to take their AP exams. Students requiring financial assistance should contact Alexia Thomas, alexia\_thomas@psbma.org, to learn more. If a student decides not to take an exam they must cancel their exam by **November 15th, 2021** to get a full refund, students can get a partial refund if they cancel by **March 15th, 2021.**   
Here are the important dates for the registration process:  
· Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM - Registration Begins  
· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 at 11:59 PM - Registrations and payments after this date will incur a $40 late fee per exam.  
· Mon, Nov 8, 2021 at 11:59 PM - Registration Ends  
· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 - Registrations that have not been paid for will be cancelled and exams will not be ordered.  
· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 - Last day to cancel an exam and receive a full refund.  
Please contact Alexia Thomas, alexia\_thomas@psbma.org , if you would like to register for an exam not listed or have any questions.
