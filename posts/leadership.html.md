**Anthony Meyer - Head of School**  
​Welcome to Brookline High School. I came here in 2004 and quickly fell for the place and the people. Brookline High is rife with wonder, learning, and adolescent energy. A former headmaster of BHS referred to this as quality as “yeasty.” I agree and appreciate daily our students’ intellectual, academic, and socio-emotional growth and learning.    
  
During my time at BHS, I served as an English teacher, associate dean, and dean before becoming head of school in 2016. In this role, I support and lead a superb faculty and staff of over three hundred who more directly impact our 2100+ students and families. More specifically, I communicate regularly with students, staff, and families; advocate for and manage resources; collaborate with community partners; and manage, support, and serve on school and district leadership teams.    
  
Brookline High School is a wonderful school: rich in learning and extracurricular opportunities and in fostering a sense of belonging among all members of our school community. BHS is also in need of scrutiny and improvement. I see this as the heart of my role: upholding what works well for students and determining what and how we can do and be better for the young people at our center.

**Brian Poon - Dean of Student Support Systems**  
Hello!  I have served in many roles at BHS since I first came in 1997.  My first position was, and my deep passion remains, teaching social studies.  I have taught a range of courses from 10th grade World History to Asian American Studies.  Over my tenure as an administrator I have been both an Associate Dean and the coordinator of an alternative program for students at-risk of dropping out.  In my current position I am responsible for the monitoring and support of all students to ensure their academic and social well being.  This includes helping lead our Student Intervention and Early Warning Data Teams as well as coordinating Title VI, Title IX, and Bullying investigations.  My job is to help the school fulfill its mission of owning the success of all students from supporting all the individual students, families, and staff at BHS, to more systemic leadership to help move the school forward towards our institutional goals.
