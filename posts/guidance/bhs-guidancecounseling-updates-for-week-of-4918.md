**After the College Acceptance/ Paying the Bill Seminar:  On Monday, April 9 at 7 pm** in the Roberts Dubbs Auditorium, BHS Guidance will host a presenter from Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA) who will provide critical information for seniors and their parents-caretakers about college financial aid award letters.  This seminar is designed to help students and families examine and compare financial aid awards, calculate the balance due at each school, and develop a plan to pay the bill at your selected college or university.  
  
**First BHS Jobs/ Career Fair! All students should check this out! This Thursday, April 12, 10:30am -12:30pm** ~Stop by the QUAD (or Atrium/MLK if bad weather)~ - FREE food and prizes - an opportunity to make $ this summer - a chance to learn about different career opportunities, networking, and jobs in and around the Brookline community We hope to see you there!  
  

​  
**Seniors and Families**  
College Decisions are out and decisions to be made by May 1.... The BHS Guidance/Counseling Dept wants to congratulate all students who have worked hard and gained admission to a college of their choice! We are also pleased to hear about students who are choosing to head out to work next year or dedicating themselves to a quality gap year experience or other worthy post grad opportunity!  
If you have questions about about your next steps, please find your guidance counselor, Mr Libenzon - College Counselor, Ms Cordner - Career Counselor. We will be reaching out to any senior who has not been in contact with their counselor about a definitive plan after graduation, so we can provide assistance in whatever way seems helpful.  
  
Seniors and parents - PLEASE READ.....  
\*\* There seem to be more students waitlisted than ever....This can be a challenging dilemma. Please check out the link below for some guidance: https://princetonreview.blog/2018/04/02/wait-wait-dont-admit-me-or-will-iever-get-off-the-waiting-list/  
\*\* When thinking about college decisions and financial aid - here are other online resources to consider, along with attending tomorrow's (Monday 4/9) Paying the Bill seminar at 7pm in the Aud-  
**Free, online calculators**  
As families anticipate sending a child to college this fall, we recommend two of our online tools designed to help them make a plan to pay for college costs:  
• Our College Cost Calculator allows families to compare colleges by recording the financial aid received from each school and viewing the resulting net price  
• Our Loan Payment Calculator displays the monthly loan payment amount and total loan cost (based on the amount families plan to borrow) for each MEFA loan repayment type  
As students and families explore their options, we encourage them to take advantage of speaking with a MEFA college planning expert. They can call us at (800) 449-MEFA (6332) or email us at info@mefa.org with any specific questions. We are happy to help.  
  
**Juniors and Families**  
Missed the BHS College Fair? Looking for other College Fair opportunities?  
\*\*\* The Boston National College Fair will be held at the Boston Convention and Exposition Center (BCEC) on: Thursday, April 12, 2018 from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. & 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Friday, April 13 from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.  
\*\*\* Westborough HS college fair Wednesday, May 30 that will be open to the public (no charge to enter). The fair will run from 7:30 to 9:00 pm, and we're hoping to have at least 100 tables (already 57 confirmed), including some Gap Year, Post-Grad, Military and career training booths in addition to colleges.
