ALL PARENTS- CAREGIVERS AND STUDENTS  
   
**May is still Mental Health Awareness Month.** Continued reminders and resources will be shared over this month. Some facts about anxiety concerns:  
​  
Anxiety is also rampant among America’s children and adolescents. Indeed, as the Psychiatric Times recently reported, “Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric condition in youth . . . with a median age of onset of 6 years.”  
As a recent update on the Effective Solutions webpage discusses – “While anxiety might seem less detrimental than depression, these disorders can negatively affect academic performance, social engagement, and family functioning. And according to a report by the Child Mind Institute, ‘Anxiety is a gateway disorder that leads to increased risk of depression, school failure, substance abuse, and suicide.’”

We have all experienced changes over and over again this past year plus. More changes will continue. BHS seniors will be heading off to new adventures – college, jobs, gap years, military, and other plans. Many Class of 2021 parents will be dealing with some changes in their homes as well. Grade 9-11 students and all faculty will be heading out to summer vacation in six weeks. Students and adults can consider these simple but time-tested strategies to manage anxiety:

*   Focus on what you can control
*   Write out your feelings on paper
*   Keep up your self-care where you can
*   Find support
*   Tune into the good
*   Make plans
*   Think of your strengths

    
See the attached “Processing Big Changes” tip sheet.

**Here is how we will celebrate YOU!**  
**Senior Surprises**  
**Wednesday is Senior Surprise Gift Day!  For your next, and final, three Wednesdays at BHS, we want to shower you with gifts!  The first surprise senior gift was distributed this past Wednesday May 12 at BHS. If you missed it, contact your dean.**

**June 6th - Graduation!**

For now, plan on having the option of graduating in-person. We also ask that you and your family keep that full day available as we will determine the time of the ceremony to coincide with the best weather that day! And hold June 3rd for Graduation Rehearsal--more details to come!**  
**June 1st - Senior Block Party!**

**Do this now if you haven’t already….**  
**If your child has not submitted the** **BHS Scholarship Application** **and CSS Profile but plans to do so, please submit it by this Wednesday.** The application is easy to complete and is available here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdp0n0dznzcGGiZ12S8sfE57lyshVlD\_DOKqlfyjz\_2yK0l1w/viewform](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/KA1VCwpRr5cgl6qpHV0Mae?domain=docs.google.com) and online on the Brookline High School homepage. To make fair decisions, the Scholarship Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com.  Submit the CSS Profile to code 0424 (the Brookline Scholarship Fund) ASAP too.  The last piece that will be required is your child's financial aid letter from the college they plan to attend. So, once that is decided, have them send Ms Whelan a screenshot/picture of their financial aid letter that college provides (or of their student portal page from the college that shows their financial aid info). Her email is [kathleen\_whelan@psbma.org](mailto:kathleen_whelan@psbma.org). We know that many students may not make this decision before May 1st.  
\-       Additional Note: The Scholarship Committee uses three criteria for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, **unmet financial need**.  There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program.    
  
  
  
   
**SENIORS AND JUNIORS**  
   
**Here’s a post high school plan different from the college route-** **The Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) is an AmeriCorps program that offers an alternative to college in a gap year format.** Applicants must be at least 17 years old, have a high school diploma or GED, be willing to comply with a criminal background check, and be a US Citizen or US National or Permanent Resident Alien. The application has now opened!  
   
The Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) is an AmeriCorps program dedicated to increasing youth academic enrichment and college and career exploration through Out-of-School-Time (OST) interventions and data-driven programming. We are a passionate team that strives every day to empower young people to succeed as part of a national movement to achieve education equity. We do this because we believe that all young people have a right to Caring Adults, Safe Spaces, A Healthy Start, An Effective Education, and An Opportunity to Serve.  
   
As a Mass Promise Fellow, participants serve at one of our partner youth-serving programs at schools, city agencies, or community-based organizations in Massachusetts. Their mission will be to build intentional relationships with young people between 6th and 12th grade and support their academic engagement or post-secondary success. Fellows will work to decrease the dropout rate, close the opportunity gap, and support the futures of youth. If someone believes in the power of relationship building to positively impact the life of a young person, this role is for them.  
   
MPF's training curriculum, networking opportunities, and career coaching provide our Fellows with the opportunity to increase their leadership development and gain meaningful skills needed for careers in the education and non-profit sectors. On average, 25% of Fellows are hired by their host site for full-time employment following their year of service. Within three months of graduating from MPF, 95% of our Fellows have full time employment or are continuing school.  
   
Students can learn more about MPF, the benefits of our program, and our host sites across Massachusetts at [https://masspromisefellows.org/apply](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/yT4pCo26yKu6zD55hzV_JR?domain=nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com)

STUDENTS' SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS FOR HELPING WITH COLLEGE/POST-HIGH SCHOOL PLANNING  
By the second semester of junior year, family stress ramps up significantly as students try to balance schoolwork, study for SATS, look into colleges or other post-BHS options, etc. All of this comes with a lot of internal and external judgment, even during years when COVID is not an issue. How can families be supportive without adding to the pressure? This year’s BHS Peer Leaders have put together some excellent tips to consider in the **Parent Tip Sheet** Student Suggestions to Parents for Helping with College/Post-High School Planning - [https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655](https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655)
