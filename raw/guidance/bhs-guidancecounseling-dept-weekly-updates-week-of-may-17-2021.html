Some facts about anxiety concerns:<br>​<br>Anxiety is also rampant among America’s children and adolescents. Indeed, as the Psychiatric Times recently reported, “Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric condition in youth . . . with a median age of onset of 6 years.”<br>As a recent update on the Effective Solutions webpage discusses – “While anxiety might seem less detrimental than depression, these disorders can negatively affect academic performance, social engagement, and family functioning. And according to a report by the Child Mind Institute, ‘Anxiety is a gateway disorder that leads to increased risk of depression, school failure, substance abuse, and suicide.’”</div>

                  <div class="paragraph">We have all experienced changes over and over again this past year plus. More changes will continue. BHS seniors will be heading off to new adventures – college, jobs, gap years, military, and other plans. Many Class of 2021 parents will be dealing with some changes in their homes as well. Grade 9-11 students and all faculty will be heading out to summer vacation in six weeks. Students and adults can consider these simple but time-tested strategies to manage anxiety:<ul>
                      <li>Focus on what you can control</li>
                      <li>Write out your feelings on paper</li>
                      <li>Keep up your self-care where you can</li>
                      <li>Find support</li>
                      <li>Tune into the good</li>
                      <li>Make plans</li>
