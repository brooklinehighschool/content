                  <div class="paragraph"><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Note that any new updates to the Weekly Update are highlighted in blue.</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>ALL PARENTS- CAREGIVERS AND STUDENTS</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>May is Mental Health Awareness Month.</strong> The focus on everyone’s mental health has been highlighted on most of the BHS Guidance/Counseling Weekly Updates over this past year and previously. More reminders and resources will be shared over this month as well.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>“YOU ARE NOT ALONE”</strong> has been a constant theme around wiping away the stigma of mental health. NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness) has adopted this saying for this awareness month. Did you know that ½ of all lifetime mental health conditions begin by age 14 and 75% by age 24? <strong>EARLY INVENTION CAN HELP!&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What can you do to help someone now?</strong> &nbsp;<strong>START A CONVERSATION</strong><br>newmethodwellness.com suggests……It can feel strange or awkward to reach out to someone who may need your assistance. But friends and family members may not feel comfortable asking for help. Therefore, one way to start a conversation is to simply ask your loved ones how they are doing.<br>You don’t have to make the conversation serious right away. Some ways to initiate a discussion like this include asking questions such as:<br>• How are you?<br>• Are you ok?<br>• Do you need to talk?<br>• What can I do to be there for you?<br>• Is there anything that you need from me?<br>• I want to know how you’re feeling because I care about you.<br>May is an excellent month to reach out to people who you haven’t spoken to in a while. Check in on your loved ones and find out if they need any support. Calling a friend who lives across the country or sending a text message to a few people from whom you haven’t heard in a while is an easy way to brighten someone’s day.<br>Remember that you are not their therapist. You don’t have to fix them. You don’t have to offer advice. Just letting someone talk and reminding them that you’re there for them may be all that your loved one needs. If someone needs more support, suggesting that you will help them find more support or go with them to talk to a trained counselor or trusted adult can be an important way to help too.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Who/what are your resources available now?</strong><br>- <strong>BHS Student Support Staff</strong> – Contact your student’s counselor or Darby Neff-Verre if you don’t know your student’s counselor.<br>- <strong>NAMI HelpLine’s</strong> contact information and hours of availability as a resource for people seeking mental health support: Monday–Friday, 10 a.m.–8 p.m., ET 800-950-NAMI (6264) info@nami.org nami.org/Help<br>- <strong>Crisis Text Line</strong> - <strong>Text&nbsp;<strong>HOME</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;</strong><a href="file://localhost/sms/741741"><strong>741741</strong></a>&nbsp;from anywhere in the United States, anytime.

We are a passionate team that strives every day to empower young people to succeed as part of a national movement to achieve education equity. We do this because we believe that all young people have a right to Caring Adults, Safe Spaces, A Healthy Start, An Effective Education, and An Opportunity to Serve.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a Mass Promise Fellow, participants serve at one of our partner youth-serving programs at schools, city agencies, or community-based organizations in Massachusetts. Their mission will be to build intentional relationships with young people between 6th and 12th grade and support their academic engagement or post-secondary success. Fellows will work to decrease the dropout rate, close the opportunity gap, and support the futures of youth. If someone believes in the power of relationship building to positively impact the life of a young person, this role is for them.<br>&nbsp;<br>MPF's training curriculum, networking opportunities,&nbsp;and career coaching provide our Fellows with the opportunity to increase their leadership development and gain meaningful skills needed for careers in the education and non-profit sectors.&nbsp;On average, 25% of Fellows are hired by their host site for full-time employment following their year of service. Within three months of graduating from MPF, 95% of our Fellows have full time employment or are continuing school.<br>&nbsp;<br>Students can learn more about MPF, the benefits of our program, and our host sites across Massachusetts at&nbsp;https://masspromisefellows.org/apply<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Are you interested in Steering?
