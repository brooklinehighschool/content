**The SWS (BHS School Within a School) admissions process is now open!**  
[http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/sws.html](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/sws.html)  
Please take the opportunity to see if SWS could be a good fit.  
   
School Within a School, located on the fourth floor of BHS, is an alternative, democratic community for a diverse group of approximately 120 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Goals for students include taking as much responsibility for their education as possible, sharing decision-making in running SWS, and contributing to building a caring community. For 50 years, SWS has provided students with the opportunity to participate actively as leaders in their own educations and develop meaningful relationships with teachers based on mutual respect. Admission to SWS is based on a lottery, the criteria of which are determined by the SWS Town Meeting. In addition to Town Meeting, SWS students take at least two classes in the program, including English. They take the rest of their classes in the mainstream of BHS. More information about the program, and the admissions process, can be found at swsbrookline.org.

Appointments are posted regularly to the MA Immunizations site but tend to go very quickly. **New appointments at local mass vaccination sites (Fenway and Gillette) are posted on THURSDAYS.**  
   
Check with your primary care physician (PCP) about their plans for their patients, unless they have already contacted you or sent out an email. (See below for messages from major medical providers in/near Brookline.) We will send out information about public Brookline vaccine clinics when it is available.  
   
Mass General Brigham (accurate as of 02.05): COVID-19 vaccine appointments are currently available for eligible patients. If you received an invitation for a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, please schedule your appointment at a Mass General Brigham vaccine clinic that is convenient for you. The easiest way to do this is through Patient Gateway. All vaccine appointment scheduling is being done at a central location for all our hospitals and clinics. Please do not contact your doctor's office about vaccine appointments. See [https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/covid19/vaccine](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/6uYYCXDk5wskyjMNCWS4jY?domain=massgeneralbrigham.org) for updates.  
   
Boston Medical Center (accurate as of 02.06): Phase 2 began on February 1. BMC patients who are eligible are now getting messages from their doctor's office telling them they can get a vaccine. This may be a text message, email, or phone call. You may also be eligible to get the vaccine at a state vaccination site; you can find more details [here](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/tUG-CYEl5xCjJm6ZHKwTQI?domain=mass.gov). See [https://www.bmc.org/covid-19-vaccine](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/fHo5CZ6m0yuXVAoRi3BF8H?domain=bmc.org) for updates.  
   
Beth Israel Lahey Health (accurate as of 02.06): We have opened a number of vaccine clinics across Eastern Massachusetts and will be offering vaccine appointments to eligible Massachusetts patients who have recently received care from a Beth Israel Lahey Health hospital, physician practice or affiliated provider. We will contact patients individually by email, phone or text when they are able to receive the vaccine based on Massachusetts state guidelines and the number of vaccine doses available. Vaccines will not be available at doctor’s offices or hospitals. See [https://coronavirus.bilh.org/vaccine/](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/3uE0C1wB4qCLDxEmhVXlCP?domain=coronavirus.bilh.org/) for updates.  
   
Atrius Health (accurate as of 02.06): At this time, Atrius Health has not yet received sufficient vaccine supply from the state, and we are unable to begin scheduling appointments for our patients 75 and older. We are hopeful we will receive vaccine in mid-February so that we can begin scheduling appointments for this priority group soon. Our practices have more than 40,000 patients who are in the 75 and older group. When we receive vaccine, we will begin general outreach to our patients 75 and older through MyHealth (our patient portal), our public website, social media, email, and other channels to invite them to schedule appointments. See [https://www.atriushealth.org/health-and-wellness/wellness-information/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/GG1UC2k1Wru0JWEGhEoAV2?domain=atriushealth.org) for updates.

Brookline Cares is a student-run, volunteer organization started by Brookline High School students. Our organization promotes awareness, fundraises, and accepts donations of winter clothing to donate to people in need. The clothing collected is given to people in communities with high rates of COVID-19 in the Greater Boston area. We are urgently raising money through a GoFundMe to purchase Empowerment coats to give out to people in communities with high rates of COVID. These communities also have high rates of poverty and homelessness. Empowerment coats are coats that convert into sleeping bags and can be used by people experiencing homelessness or people who do not have shelter.  Visit their website for more information: https://www.empowermentplan.org/the-coat. The coats will be distributed by Mass General to people in Revere, Chelsea, Lynn, Charlestown, and Everett through their mobile testing vans. If you want to help make a positive difference in the world we live in, then this is the perfect cause to donate to.

**Are you still trying to figure out what your plans are after graduation?**  If the answer is yes, check out the opportunity to serve with City Year. **City Year is a one-year program where you work full-time in an urban Elementary, Middle, or High School** bridging the gap between the support that students actually need and what their schools are designed and resourced to provide. They are looking for folks that have a passion for working with youth and would be willing to work hard to help them to see their full potential. They partner with schools and districts to identify students who are at risk of not graduating on time with their peers, and provide them with extra academic, emotional, and social support, and the skills that they need to be successful for college and a career.  To learn more about City Year contact recruitment manager, Kristen Hill, at Khill1@cityyear.org

The PreACT is a shorter practice version of the ACT college admissions test, normed for sophomores in high school. The PreACT also offers a built-in career interest inventory. Each student taking the test will have the opportunity to:  
   
v Identify current academic readiness for college and career using the PreACT report  
v Predict how you’ll perform on the ACT after an additional junior year of  learning (predictive quality of test is different for juniors since they already are having that “additional year” of  curriculum as defined by the ACT)  
v Determine skills you can improve based on your performance (using your results to guide use of the free online ACT Academy prep program)  
v Explore how your career aspirations align with your interests.
