                  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;">¡Hola amigos! It's me, Skye, writing about my amazing birthday that I spent here in Cuernavaca yesterday. I started off my day with breakfast with my host family. My host mother served us cake with our breakfast for my birthday, which was delicious! We then headed over to the school, and we took our placement exams. If we weren't being tested, we would be hanging by the pool. It was really nice to bond with my fellow trip goers while enjoying the heat of the Mexican sun. After the exams, we found out our groups and then headed to class for a few hours. ¡Class was muy divertido! After class, we went back to our host families to eat the main meal of the day- lunch! There was an abundance of food, and even after I was done eating (or so I thought), my family kept bringing out more. After chilling at home for a bit, it was time to go explore downtown. The group met at the school, and from there we took taxis to the center of Cuernavaca. The taxi was definitely an experience, and driving on the streets of Cuernavaca felt like I was in a car racing video game. It was really fun! When we got to downtown, the center was beautiful. The buildings were vibrant with color, and the cathedral we visited was amazing. We then headed to the marketplace, and had some free time to shop around. I bought some pens and bracelets, and they cost less than 5 USD! Wow. I love how cheap everything is here. It makes me feel rich :) After shopping, we got to watch the sunset over the hills of downtown Cuernavaca. It was fabuloso.&nbsp;</div>
