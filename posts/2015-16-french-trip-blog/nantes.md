Just a few images today from yesterday's adventure to Les Machines in Nantes.  Take note of our two students in the bird baskets.

							Woah! That's really cool that they made a work of art like this. I wonder what they did to made the art and baskets strong enough to hold someone. At the very least, it looks like a ton of fun!

							It looks like you are all having a wonderful trip filled with lots of cool food, sights and fun. I can't believe how many places you've been already and how much you've seen. I really hope I get to go on this trip in a few years. That sculpture must be so fun to sit in!

							The trip looked so fun and knowledge based too! full of exciting and enriching things to learn but at the same time very interactive. Learning the language and being able to learn about the place and historical events that took place there. I loved how engaging the students were and getting ready to each of the students perspectives on each thing they did. It's great they everyone got to write about something they did each day. It felt like reading a journal or diary and was fun to read. I loved how there was a picture with everything.
