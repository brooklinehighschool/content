**Grade 9, 10, 11 Students  - Course Request Information**   
**– STUDENTS - Add elective and wellness course requests to portal until end of day this Thursday 3/21**  
   
From Mr. Mason, Assistant Head of School: The student portal continues to be open for course registration for the 2019/2020 school year. The deadline for student course requests is Thursday, March 21. You can also watch a short video explaining the course selection process at: [https://youtu.be/NksLUjRkWx8](https://youtu.be/NksLUjRkWx8)  
Please spend some time until this Thursday March 21 reviewing these important decisions with your child to help choose a strong schedule for next year. Students should also speak to teachers and counselors for course selection advice. Again this year we have asked teachers to spend more time on the “comments” attached to the course recommendations. These comments should give you and your child additional information helpful in creating a balanced schedule. Please remember that students are responsible for knowing and meeting all our graduation requirements.  
The course selections that you make this month determine how we staff the high school. Therefore choose courses carefully and commit to those courses for 2019-2020 as there is not always room to make changes and switches later. Students overriding teacher recommendations must do so by April 2, 2019. To proceed with an override please have your child contact the guidance counselor.

**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS**  
   
The recent college admissions scandal has shed some light on possible abuses and inequity in this often challenging process. BHS Guidance does its best to offer support and resources to all students in an ethical and caring way. Students have a responsibility to attend required seminars, reach out to BHS counselors and/or College Counselor Lenny Libenzon, and take responsibility for their post-high school planning process. If any student or parent has concerns about this process, please feel free to contact Darby Neff-Verre  at [darby\_neff-verre@psbma.org](mailto:darby_neff-verre@psbma.org). Please read this article for an important perspective -

**PTO Funding highlight**...As part of the generosity of the PTO 2018-19 Guidance Fund, BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon and Darby Neff-Verre chaperoned 18 BHS juniors for a college visit to UMass Lowell on Wednesday March 6. This visit was an opportunity for these students to officially visit the campus and attend an information session, plus enjoy a hearty lunch in the campus dining hall. Many of these students had not visited a college campus officially before, so they were able to learn about this particular university and also begin to sort out what might be important to them as they consider college after BHS graduation. Thank you BHS PTO and parents who donate to the PTO Fund!  
   
**TRANSITIONING TO COLLEGE: EXPERT GUIDANCE AND ADVICE FOR PARENTS OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH ADHD, LEARNING DISABILITIES, AND AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (LEVEL 1)** – see attached flyer for full day parent workshop in Newton, April 6, 2019, Sliding Scale Fee available.

**A SURVIVAL GUIDE TO PARENTING TEENS The BHS PTO presents Joani Geltman: Talking to Your Kids About Sexting, Drinking, Drugs, and Other Things that FREAK YOU OUT. April 3, 2019 at 7 pm in the BHS Auditorium**. Joani Geltman, MSW, an expert in child development and parent-teen relationships, returns to Brookline for “A Survival Guide to Parenting Teens.” Using humor and more than 30 years of experience, Geltman shares stories and advice that defuse some of the anxiety parents feel as their children move through tricky developmental milestones. Parents will learn about setting realistic expectations and appropriate limits, social media “do’s and don’t’s,” and how to identify and deal with teen experimentation with sex, vaping, marijuana, and alcohol. Parents will head home with a greater understanding of their teen’s behavior and needs, as well as very practical parenting tools they can begin to use immediately. Please register for this free event.

Please go to the BHS Guidance website for a helpful info sheet for many ideas (updated 1/31/19).

Please note that attending a pre-college program at any particular college does not usually offer any special consideration during future admissions at that school.

**Mark your calendars for MA Educational Financing Authority’s Paying the Bill presentation – Wed April 10, 7pm, BHS Auditorium** - Parents and students are invited to attend a free seminar on understanding financial aid award letters and making a plan to pay the college bill. This seminar is offered through MEFA, the Commonwealth’s authority on planning, saving, and paying for college. An experienced MEFA representative will provide an overview of the college payment process, including the details of financial aid award letters, using payment plans, different financing options, and how to minimize debt. Before the seminar, be sure to visit MEFA’s website — [mefa.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmefa.org&sa=D&ust=1553194361106000&usg=AFQjCNGYqF5L9guIIf19g7eGsqBnriBAEg) — to download a copy of the seminar presentation in English or Spanish and explore other tools and resources to assist you in the college planning process.

**If your grade 12 student would like to apply for the BHS Scholarships but has not done so already, please have them submit their scholarship application ASAP**. The application is easy to complete and can be found on the home page of the Brookline High School website. After completing the scholarship app, your student's CSS Profile (found on the College Board website) needs to submitted to the Brookline High School Scholarship Program - code 0424. Once students decide which college they will attend next year, they need to either email or bring a copy of their financial aid letter from that college to Ms. Whelan.  
Questions? Please contact Ms. Whelan at her email - [kathleen\_whelan@psbma.org](mailto:kathleen_whelan@psbma.org) or drop off documents to her office is in room 317.  
Please note: The Scholarship Committee would like parents/guardians to know that three criteria are used for choosing award recipients: academics, contributions and activities at BHS, and most importantly, unmet financial need. There are no merit scholarships per se given out through this program. To make fair decisions, the Committee requires that families fill out the CSS Profile financial aid form, available at CollegeBoard.com. Please use code #0424  
   
College admissions decisions are now happening! Congratulations to students who are receiving good news! If you are still waiting or have concerns about your admissions decisions so far, please contact your counselor or Lenny Libenzon so we can work with you moving forward. Although waitlist numbers can change dramatically at the same school from year to year, see how many students were on the 2017-18 school year waitlist in this article - [https://www.collegetransitions.com/waitlist-statistics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.collegetransitions.com%2Fwaitlist-statistics&sa=D&ust=1552665353896000&usg=AFQjCNHJ2KsDFPSLWOqPgFn7yaAPXmLtwA)  
   
    
**READ YOUR EMAIL IF YOU HAVE APPLIED TO COLLEGE! Set up and check your portal for each college. If you have questions, students should be contacting the admissions offices, not parents…..
