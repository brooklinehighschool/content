Goals for students include taking as much responsibility for their education as possible, sharing decision-making in running SWS, and contributing to building a caring community. For 50 years, SWS has provided students with the opportunity to participate actively as leaders in their own educations and develop meaningful relationships with teachers based on mutual respect. Admission to SWS is based on a lottery, the criteria of which are determined by the SWS Town Meeting. In addition to Town Meeting, SWS students take at least two classes in the program, including English. They take the rest of their classes in the mainstream of BHS.&nbsp;More information about the program, and the admissions process, can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/1cMBCG6Q8xuqkq3YI7B7GC?domain=swsbrookline.org">swsbrookline.org</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br><br></div>
