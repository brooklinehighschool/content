**THE TRUTH ABOUT VAPING – UPDATED FOR FALL 2019**  
From nicotine addiction to life-threatening respiratory illness, the health risks of e-cigarettes (vapes, juuls) have been all over the news lately, and Brookline is not immune. In fact, vaping among our middle and high school students is on the rise. What do parents need to know? And what can we do to help our kids fully understand that these products are not harmless? Through the generosity of a Brookline community member in collaboration with PSB/ BHS Counseling-Guidance Department, Caron Treatment Centers will present a **special informational parent event on October 28 at 7 p.m. in the Brookline High School Auditorium**. Please join us for this free presentation. Registration requested at [https://thetruthaboutvaping.eventbrite.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thetruthaboutvaping.eventbrite.com&sa=D&ust=1569589920787000&usg=AOvVaw0eFnaM99p24OQLDRkAduFn)

**Encourage your child to be in touch with their guidance counselor.**    
With 9th grade students and staff at Old Lincoln, many 10th to 12th graders' guidance counselors and deans changed this year.  To find out who your student's guidance counselor is, log on to [Aspen](https://ma-brookline.myfollett.com/aspen/logon.do), click on "Family" tab and then on (one of) your student's name.  The middle column will list their 'administrator/dean and guidance counselor.  Most the counselors with students in Grades 10,11,12 have moved their offices to the new Counseling/Guidance HUB in Room 285. Kara Lopez (who also works with ACE students) will stay in her Room 248. Dan Bresman (SWS Counselor/ Program Director) is still in Room 400A. For more information on guidance and counseling support staff, contact info, and locations, see the attached PDF below.  
Our goal is to offer BHS students support as they develop into caring, resilient, capable, and academically balanced young adults during their high school years and beyond.

Senior mentors with early deadlines should see also see their counselors individually to hand off transcript release forms and to make sure you are on track for your deadlines.  
   
**L Grade** – This BHS policy is most impactful for seniors. If you are struggling in a course and considering moving to a different curriculum level, it is advisable to **have this process completed by this Wed 10/23**. If you wait until later in quarter 1, you will have an L grade on your transcript for colleges.  The L grade policy states:  
**L = If a course level change occurs within ten class periods of the end of a marking period the student will earn a grade of “L” (Late entry) in the new course for that marking period.**
