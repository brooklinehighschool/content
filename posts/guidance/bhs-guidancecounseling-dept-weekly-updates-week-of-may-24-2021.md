 **Please make sure to print and sign the attached consent form and have the student bring it to school** **on the day of the clinic**. Parent or Guardian signatures are required for any students under the age of 18.  All students will be vaccinated free of charge regardless of insurance coverage. If insured please enter insurance information in the online registration. Once registered online there is no need to bring an insurance card to the clinic. A follow up clinic for second doses will be on June 10th, June 16th and June 17th, in accordance with your first vaccine. The registration link will be provided to register for the second dose at a later time. Students who have already received their first dose of the Pfizer series at another location are welcome to register for either date to receive their second shot as long as there has been at least 3 weeks between doses.  
We have attached the vaccine consent form in case you have difficulty doing this online. Please be sure that your student brings the consent to the appointment.  
The CDC announced last week their approval for the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine in adolescents aged 12 and above.  
The American Academy of Pediatrics urges all eligible adults and adolescents to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available to them. The AAP highlights the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine while pushing for clinical trials to include younger children as an urgent next step toward ending the spread of the virus.  
**While the vaccine is strongly encouraged, it is not required at this time.**  
HIgh School students do not need a parent present for vaccine administration if they have been signed up, consent signed by parent (if under 18), and brought to the vaccine clinic.  
We encourage you to discuss this with your pediatrician or health care provider if you have questions. If your child has or will receive the vaccine elsewhere, we ask that you submit documentation of the vaccine administration to your school nurse once received.

**SENIORS AND JUNIORS**  
   
**Here’s a post high school plan different from the college route-** **The Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) is an AmeriCorps program that offers an alternative to college in a gap year format.** Applicants must be at least 17 years old, have a high school diploma or GED, be willing to comply with a criminal background check, and be a US Citizen or US National or Permanent Resident Alien. The application has now opened!  
   
The Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) is an AmeriCorps program dedicated to increasing youth academic enrichment and college and career exploration through Out-of-School-Time (OST) interventions and data-driven programming. We are a passionate team that strives every day to empower young people to succeed as part of a national movement to achieve education equity. We do this because we believe that all young people have a right to Caring Adults, Safe Spaces, A Healthy Start, An Effective Education, and An Opportunity to Serve.  
   
As a Mass Promise Fellow, participants serve at one of our partner youth-serving programs at schools, city agencies, or community-based organizations in Massachusetts. Their mission will be to build intentional relationships with young people between 6th and 12th grade and support their academic engagement or post-secondary success. Fellows will work to decrease the dropout rate, close the opportunity gap, and support the futures of youth. If someone believes in the power of relationship building to positively impact the life of a young person, this role is for them.  
   
MPF's training curriculum, networking opportunities, and career coaching provide our Fellows with the opportunity to increase their leadership development and gain meaningful skills needed for careers in the education and non-profit sectors. On average, 25% of Fellows are hired by their host site for full-time employment following their year of service. Within three months of graduating from MPF, 95% of our Fellows have full time employment or are continuing school.  
   
Students can learn more about MPF, the benefits of our program, and our host sites across Massachusetts at [https://masspromisefellows.org/apply](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/yT4pCo26yKu6zD55hzV_JR?domain=nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com)

STUDENTS' SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS FOR HELPING WITH COLLEGE/POST-HIGH SCHOOL PLANNING  
By the second semester of junior year, family stress ramps up significantly as students try to balance schoolwork, study for SATS, look into colleges or other post-BHS options, etc. All of this comes with a lot of internal and external judgment, even during years when COVID is not an issue. How can families be supportive without adding to the pressure? This year’s BHS Peer Leaders have put together some excellent tips to consider in the **Parent Tip Sheet** Student Suggestions to Parents for Helping with College/Post-High School Planning - [https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr.\_parent\_tip\_sheet.pdf?mc\_cid=95767123c3&mc\_eid=ca3683a655](https://www.b-pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655pen.org/uploads/2/9/2/9/2929884/jr._parent_tip_sheet.pdf?mc_cid=95767123c3&mc_eid=ca3683a655)
