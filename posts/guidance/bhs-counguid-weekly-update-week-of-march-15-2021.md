[BHS Coun/Guid Weekly Update - Week of March 15, 2021](//bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance/bhs-counguid-weekly-update-week-of-march-15-2021)

			
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		3/14/2021
	

It’s been a long year of COVID, with many people struggling with physical, mental health and academic challenges, food and housing insecurity, racial and ethnic injustice. Through it all, please remember that We Are Brookline High Warriors - This is hard. You can do it. We can help you!  
  
Four important guidance related messages and events are highlighted here again this week:

*   Almost everyone’s mental health has been affected this past year. Be sure to take some time to read recent messages from BHS. (This information is also listed below and attached to this email.) Take the time to take care of yourself too!  ​ 
*   Students in Grades 9-11 will continue to add their course requests for 2021-22 into their student portals through 3/30.  See attached portal instructions given to students in hubs/advisories last week. As courses are considered, school and life BALANCE for each student is key. Students should have heard from their teachers regarding course level recommendations. They also should be aware of what credits they need to earn a BHS diploma by their graduation. The 2021-22 BHS Course Catalog is now available [on the BHS homepage](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/) 

 

*   There will be 2 IPRs (progress reports) for this Quarter 3. The first IPR was posted to student and parent portals on Monday 3/8. Please be sure to review this information. It’s great to validate academic successes and to provide constructive problem solving with your student in areas of challenge. Have your student reach out to their teachers and available academic supports if needed.

  

*   This week is a regular week of school. No special schedule!

Brookline Scholarship application period ends on April 15. All students who would like to be considered for the BHS scholarships (which are need based) need to submit their scholarship applications and CSS Profile by April 15th.   
The scholarship application link is: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdp0n0dznzcGGiZ12S8sfE57lyshVlD\_DOKqlfyjz\_2yK0l1w/viewform](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/QhRJCo26yKu6B6vAI1GUQ1?domain=docs.google.com) and can also be found on the main page of the BHS website.  
The CSS Profile is located on the College Board website. It must be completed and submitted to the BHS Scholarship Fund - code 0424.  
  
The March BHS Scholarship Letter is now available – please see the attached letter   
  
If you got into a school and you are 100% sure you will not go there, please let them know (especially if this is a state school).  Colleges are experiencing a huge increase in applications this year, and are therefore using waitlist and deferrals--so your email might help another student get in.  
   
Interested in applying to Framingham State University? You have a great opportunity to get accepted on the spot at Framingham State University…. Join FSU and BHS for a Virtual Admissions Decision Day. Register to meet with an FSU admissions representative to discuss your application and receive your decision (please note, in some cases FSU will not be able to provide a decision at the time of meeting, but will let you know what your next steps are. Application fees will be waived for participating applicants). Here are the steps:  
1) [Make an appointment](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/NbaHCv29Z5u4kyN0cQlTs-?domain=admissions.framingham.edu) for the zoom session. Important: this will be a zoom meeting with the FSU Admissions Counselor who makes the admission decisions.  Please come on time & represent BHS well.  
2) Complete [Commonapp.org](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/BI3PCwpRr5cPwR8Zfqyskm?domain=commonapp.org/)  for FSU, or [FSU’s own application](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/kPbGCxk715uBWQMqcYrfXL?domain=admissions.framingham.edu/). Framingham State does not require an essay. To get the fee waiver, there is a question on both the FSU App, and then on the Common App (in the FSU questions) that asks if you are eligible for a school specific waiver. Select "official campus visit." It's okay if you submit the app before the meeting, once the meeting takes place FSU will make sure the app fee is waived.  
3) Complete the [transcript release form](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/KGPBCyPJX5uJByXmTRFtlg?domain=forms.gle), & email Mr. Libenzon ([lenny\_libenzon@psbma.org](mailto:lenny_libenzon@psbma.org)) to indicate that you will attend the on-the-spot session.
