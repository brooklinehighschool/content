**JUNIORS**  
   
ALL JUNIORS!  **PSAT results** will be available online via the College Board website on approximately during this week of Dec 10. Students who took this practice test should be receiving an email from the College Board to announce that scores are available and to provide directions for access. College Board accounts should be created by students, so we have no way of knowing their username/passwords. If a student cannot access their account, they should try the "forgot the password" feature first. If that doesn't work, Lenny Libenzon can help students with access when they drop by College-Career Center 279 or his office 280. Last year, issues arose when a student's parents used their own emails to create the account.  
  
To better understand the information on the score reports, students and parents can view PSAT video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQGjsOQGpU-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQGjsOQGpU-)   
   
This **Thursday, 12/13 X block room 020, Mr Libenzon will conduct a quick overview of how to interpret your PSAT scores**. You are welcome to stop by and ask any questions.  
  
Students can contact their counselor for more information – stop by, leave a note, send an email if they are not available.   
**WE ENCOURAGE ALL JUNIORS TO DO A FEW THINGS AFTER VIEWING THEIR SCORES:**  
1- MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR COUNSELOR TO DISCUSS SCORES AND START THINKING ABOUT COLLEGE PLANNING  
2- USE THE FREE ONLINE KHAN ACADEMY LINKED TO THE PSAT REPORT TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORES  
3- ATTEND THE 12/11/18 7pm EVENT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BHS JUNIOR YEAR TIMELINE AND TO HAVE AN IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION OF COLLEGE ADMISSIONS TESTING INFORMATION  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
   
**SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS**  
**Junior Year Calendar and Standardized College Admissions Testing presentation -** Tuesday, December 11, 2018, at 7 pm, in the BHS Auditorium - BHS Guidance Department with Lenny Libenzon, BHS College Counselor, will go over the Junior Year Calendar, and Drew Heilpern from Summit Educational Group will talk about the different types of standardized tests that our juniors take (SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT, AP). This night is open to junior and sophomore students and their parents/caregivers. Please note that BHS does not specifically promote any outside testing prep companies, but appreciates their information sharing for this event.  
Special presentation before this event on December 11, 2018 – Please come early…**Why Students Need to Rethink Social Media in 2018!** Today, both colleges and employers are actively looking at students' social media profiles.  Many employers are using third-party background screening companies as part of their hiring process. Legally, these companies can look at up to seven years of internet and social media history, which means **what students are posting today** may be part of a social media audit that could affect their prospective employment opportunities. Join Robin Clebnik, Career Exploration Expert and founder of InternBoston, as she explains exactly what information prospective schools and employers are looking for, as well as how students can use social media to build an authentic,discoverable and informative digital presence. There’s time for a Q + A at the end of the talk and all participants will receive a digital copy of this presentation.  
  
**SOPHOMORES/ Some Juniors**  
**The PreACT will be administered at Brookline High this Saturday,**  
**December 15th from 7:45- 11:45 am. Please report to BHS, Clinic Room 147 by 7:45 a.m. to find your testing room location. Bring picture/ School ID, 3 sharpened #2 pencils and a calculator for math – act.org/theact/calculator (although calculator not required). No phones/devices allowed.**  
   
The PreACT is a shorter practice version of the ACT college admissions test, normed for sophomores in high school. The PreACT also offers a built-in career interest inventory.   
Each student taking the test will have the opportunity to:  
\-  Identify current academic readiness for college and career using the PreACT report  
\-  Predict how you’ll perform on the ACT after an additional junior year of learning (predictive quality of test is different for juniors since they already are having an “additional year” of curriculum as defined by the ACT)  
\-  Determine skills you can improve based on your performance (using your results to guide use of the free online ACT Academy prep program)  
\-   Explore how your career aspirations align with your interests  
   
**PreACT score reports will be available in school at a PreACT score report overview X block, Thurs January 10th.
