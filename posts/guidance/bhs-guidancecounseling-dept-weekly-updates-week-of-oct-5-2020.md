​Welcome to October! Thank you for taking the time to read these updates. If you have any feedback to share, please contact [Darby Neff-Verre](mailto:darby_neff-verre@psbma.org).   
In the past update email, one of the attached FAQs 'Whom To Call When at BHS” indicated that parents/caregivers would have observer access to their student’s CANVAS account. This was not accurately updated and parents do not have this access. The newly updated document is attached with this update.  
The goal for our high school students is to help them build responsibility and independence as learners and young people in our world. Students should be learning to use these attributes to they are ready for life after high school. However, you are concerned about your student’s follow through with school work, first talk to them. Find out what is working (and not working) from their perspective. As a way to keep communication flowing between teachers, students, parents/caregivers, and support staff, BHS teachers will be completing the first of two IPRs (Interim Progress Reports) for every student during this 1st quarter of the school year. This IPR #1 will be shared on the Parent and Student Portal by tentatively this Friday 10/9/20. More information on this IPR initiative will be forthcoming from the BHS Head of School, Anthony Meyer, and the Assistant Head of School, Hal Mason, soon.  
Lastly, a reminder that student schedules overall should be getting finalized by this week for any unresolved issues.  
Counselors are here and ready to support EVERY BHS student. Students should not hesitate to contact their counselor for any questions or concerns – school related, post high school planning related, extracurricular activities related, or life related!

Seniors – When submitting your transcript release forms electronically, please:

*   **use the updated link** shared by your counselor (on their CANVAS page or by email)
*   be sure to **list your college names and addresses CORRECTLY AS THEY APPEAR OFFICIALLY ON THE COLLEGE’S WEBSITE OR NAVIANCE**. The processing of your request is slowed down by not including the official name of the college or putting in wrong information.
*   **Review your unofficial transcript** shared by your counselor. Look for any omissions or errors of your courses/grades before we send your transcript to the colleges you apply to. Note – as we work through systems issues, some unofficial transcripts will have student’s “working” GPA listed on this document. We will not be sharing any GPA information with colleges on official transcripts however.

**Students Taking an AP Course**\-    
If you are not taking an AP course this year, and don't plan to take an AP exam this year, please disregard this email.  
The College Board **ordering deadline for all exams is November 13th**.  Any exam ordered after this date will be an additional $40 late fee. Students need to register and pay for their AP exams using our Total Registration website.    
Our AP exam registration period is from:  
**Friday October 2nd - Thursday Nov. 12th.**  Students will register for their exams on Total Registration and pay online using a credit card.   
[www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/_ENACAD91osnRZl4h8wfh8?domain=user.totalregistration.net)  
The **cost of each test is $98**, and students can request financial assistance if needed.  
In order to access the new, free online resources provided by the College Board, **all students (and teachers) must also register for their class on the Collegeboard website**.  I've attached a document from the College Board, which outlines the steps for students.   
**Step #1 - Register for your exam via Total Registration**  
   
**Step #2 - Join your AP Class Section, using the College Board Website** ([www.myap.collegeboard.org](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/1J1jCBBR6psMnDRjtNUl_4?domain=myap.collegeboard.org)) and use your College Board student account login, as well as your course join code, and fill out the information needed.  (Join codes are given to you via total registration or via your teacher).   
Please let Ms Thomas ([alexia\_thomas@psbmal.org](mailto:alexia_thomas@psbmal.org)) or Ms Kennedy (kate\_kennedy@psbma.org) know if you have questions. If students do not complete both steps, registering and paying on Total Registration and signing up for MyAP on the College Board website, **they cannot order an AP exam** for you.
