As Quarter 3 continues (midpoint for Q3 is 3/11), students in Grades 9-11 are also considering their course requests for the next school year.

Brookline Cares is a student-run, volunteer organization started by Brookline High School students. Our organization promotes awareness, fundraises, and accepts donations of winter clothing to donate to people in need. The clothing collected is given to people in communities with high rates of COVID-19 in the Greater Boston area. We are urgently raising money through a GoFundMe to purchase Empowerment coats to give out to people in communities with high rates of COVID. These communities also have high rates of poverty and homelessness. Empowerment coats are coats that convert into sleeping bags and can be used by people experiencing homelessness or people who do not have shelter.  Visit their website for more information: https://www.empowermentplan.org/the-coat. The coats will be distributed by Mass General to people in Revere, Chelsea, Lynn, Charlestown, and Everett through their mobile testing vans. If you want to help make a positive difference in the world we live in, then this is the perfect cause to donate to.

And please don’t forget to have some fun, even in these strange times!  
   
**If you got into a school and you are 100% sure you will not go there, please let them know (especially if this is a state school).**  Colleges are experiencing a huge increase in applications this year, and are therefore using waitlist and deferrals--so your email might help another student get in.  
   
**Interested in applying to Framingham State University? You have a great opportunity to get accepted on the spot at Framingham State University**…. Join FSU and BHS for a Virtual Admissions Decision Day.

**1)** Make an appointment for the zoom session. Important: this will be a zoom meeting with the FSU Admissions Counselor who makes the admission decisions.  Please come on time & represent BHS well.  
**2)** Complete Commonapp.org  for FSU, or FSU’s own application. Framingham State does not require an essay. To get the fee waiver, there is a question on both the FSU App, and then on the Common App (in the FSU questions) that asks if you are eligible for a school specific waiver. Select "official campus visit." It's okay if you submit the app before the meeting, once the meeting takes place FSU will make sure the app fee is waived.  
**3)** Complete the transcript release form, & email Mr. Libenzon (lenny\_libenzon@psbma.org) to indicate that you will attend the on-the-spot session.

They are looking for folks that have a passion for working with youth and would be willing to work hard to help them to see their full potential. They partner with schools and districts to identify students who are at risk of not graduating on time with their peers, and provide them with extra academic, emotional, and social support, and the skills that they need to be successful for college and a career.  To learn more about City Year contact recruitment manager, Kristen Hill, at Khill1@cityyear.org
