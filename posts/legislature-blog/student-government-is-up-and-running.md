This weeks blog entry comes from one of our 9th Grade Representatives: Kalina Brookfield  
​  
This fall, the student council has been working hard to help BHS through the new 2020-2021 school year. We’ve been making progress on a Sports Credit bill that will make it easier for students to receive proper credit for their athletics, started committee work in our newly established committees, and worked on creating surveys to get valuable feedback from the student body.  
We’ll be doing our best to get new blog posts out more consistently for the rest of this year, so make sure to stay tuned for future updates!
