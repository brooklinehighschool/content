[Updates from BHS Counseling/Guid Dept – Week of May 18, 2020](//bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance/updates-from-bhs-counselingguid-dept-week-of-may-182020)

​It’s still May, so the focus on Mental Health Awareness continues….and will continue through every weekly update moving forward. It seems many students, educators and support staff, and parents/family members I have been in contact with this past week are feeling the “stuckness” of our quarantine. As an antidote to this vibe, I find many of the short stories shared on the online Grown and Flown app to be relevant and often add some humor to important topics. The short article “How to Get Up and Go When Your Motivation Got Up and Went” by Elizabeth Spencer may hit the mark for many BHS students, colleagues, and parents this week. [The full article is here, with these highlights of her “pep talk”:](https://grownandflown.com/how-to-get-motivated/)

*   Aim for better than zero.
*   Plan for something you’re pretty sure you can count on.
*   Just start.
*   Do the works (aka get the dreaded thing done!)
*   Make someone else’s day. 

  
Feel free to check the [Student and Family Mental Health and Social Services Resource List](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/WeB8C5y1Lxc6R442hz1P32?domain=b-pen.org) on the BHS homepage for regularly updated resources for anyone in the Brookline community. As always, be sure to reach out to a counselor, dean, or other caring BHS staff member if you have any questions or concerns about school or ways to manage during this quarantine time. We’re here for you!

Again, this week’s complete Counseling/Guidance department weekly update will again be shared with all BHS students and guardians so everyone can see announcements for the entire community. Be well!

Summer student experiences – None of us know exactly what Summer 2020 will be like. To that end, we’ll add ideas that pop up on our radar over the next weeks, plus work on updating the BHS Summer Planning Experiences list shared earlier in the spring. Please note that sharing this information is NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF PARTICULAR PROGRAMS.  Here’s an example:  [Banson NYC Virtual Fashion Career Camp](https://www.bansonnyc.com/) (also camps focusing on Fashion Design and Fashion Styling) This week-long program will teach students the fundamentals of the fashion industry by providing an insider's perspective. We will design each camp to spotlight a wide variety of careers in the industry - merchandising, media, design, styling, buying, blogging, public relations, production to name a few. Each week will also include interactive activities like a Master Class in Beauty with your own personal beauty box, a sustainable design project with a chance to win a prize and tips on successful interviewing techniques and appropriate attire to wear. We will end the program with a panel discussion from former students on how they landed internships and advice they have for making your college choice the right fit for you. Each camp will be 18-20 hours long. We will have an orientation on Sunday afternoon and then begin the program on Monday at 11:00 am (NYC time). We accept applications on a first come, first served basis.  
The cost is $650.00 per student but use code STAYWELL to receive 20% off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   
Session A: June 14, 2020 - June 19, 2020  
Session B: July 12, 2020 - July 17, 2020  
  
AP exams – We know there have been some glitches and some successes for BHS students taking online AP exams over this past week. College Board has been mad aware of concerns. Big thanks to our Brookline High AP Coordinators - Alexia Thomas and Kate Kennedy – who continue to field questions, listen to complaints, and advocate for fixes to problems that have happened so far! As we move into week #2 of APs, we hope things continue to improve for all. Here’s information from the well-respected [COMPASS Educational Group website](https://www.compassprep.com/2020-ap-exam-policies/) about colleges’ acceptance of the new 2020 AP exams for placement: “The \[new AP policy\] announcement… prompted questions about whether colleges would accept the 2020 exams, and if so, how enthusiastically, and on what terms?  Nearly two months after the announcement, many colleges have announced their policies; we’ve tracked, assembled, and coded the policies for over 100 competitive National Universities, and 25 Liberal Arts Colleges, in the table below. We will continue to update this resource as schools release statements about their AP credit policies.”   
  
  
SENIORS

NINTH GRADERS  
  
The OLS counselors continue to post 2 videos each week on CANVAS to touch base with their students and keep them informed. Students – be sure to check them out and also share with your parents-guardians!  
  
Counselors of 9th graders also shared a survey with all OLS students last week on CANVAS to gather questions from freshmen about 10th grade. As of last Friday, many 9th graders had responded but we want more to check it out! OLS Counselors and Deans will be answering these questions in upcoming parent and student events and communications.
