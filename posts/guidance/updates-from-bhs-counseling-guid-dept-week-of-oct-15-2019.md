**Save the date—Oct. 28 – for THE TRUTH ABOUT VAPING – UPDATED FOR FALL 2019**  
From nicotine addiction to life-threatening respiratory illness, the health risks of e-cigarettes (vapes, juuls) have been all over the news lately, and Brookline is not immune. In fact, vaping among our middle and high school students is on the rise. What do parents need to know? And what can we do to help our kids fully understand that these products are not harmless? Through the generosity of a Brookline community member in collaboration with PSB/ BHS Counseling-Guidance Department, Caron Treatment Centers will present a special informational parent event on October 28 at 7 p.m. in the Brookline High School Auditorium. Save the date! Please join us for this free presentation. Registration requested at [https://thetruthaboutvaping.eventbrite.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thetruthaboutvaping.eventbrite.com&sa=D&ust=1569589920787000&usg=AOvVaw0eFnaM99p24OQLDRkAduFn)

**Encourage your child to be in touch with their guidance counselor.**    
With 9th grade students and staff at Old Lincoln, many 10th to 12th graders' guidance counselors and deans changed this year.  To find out who your student's guidance counselor is, log on to [Aspen](https://ma-brookline.myfollett.com/aspen/logon.do), click on "Family" tab and then on (one of) your student's name.  The middle column will list their 'administrator/dean and guidance counselor.  Most the counselors with students in Grades 10,11,12 have moved their offices to the new Counseling/Guidance HUB in Room 285. Kara Lopez (who also works with ACE students) will stay in her Room 248. Dan Bresman (SWS Counselor/ Program Director) is still in Room 400A. For more information on guidance and counseling support staff, contact info, and locations, see the attached PDF below.  
Our goal is to offer BHS students support as they develop into caring, resilient, capable, and academically balanced young adults during their high school years and beyond.
