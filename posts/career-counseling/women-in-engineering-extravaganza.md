**​UMass Women in Engineering Extravaganza for High School Students Tuesday, October 20th – Friday, October 30th**   
While we’re packing the two weeks with opportunities to make connections with awesome women engineering undergraduate and graduate students as well as women alumni and friends working in the field, ALL students are welcome, either as individuals or through your classrooms.   
  
[Click here to see details on the dates/times/events. We’re working on a few more to add! LIVE events will be via Zoom, but we’ll be posting everything in a platform called Hopin.to, where you’ll be able to access recordings “on demand” from October 21st - 23rd and 28th - 30th. About Hopin.To: Drop-in to Hopin.to to learn more about UMass Engineering and see if engineering is a career path for you. You'll be able to explore engineering student clubs and organizations through their Expo booths. We'll post recordings of all the live panels and design challenge launches from the week in case you missed them. Some of our departments will also post messages. We'll be updating the site throughout the three days as information becomes available, and we'll open the site up again during week 2!](/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/2020_women_in_engineering_days_info.pdf)

** Engineering Challenges: We have a number of engineering challenges that will launch October 20th – 22nd.
