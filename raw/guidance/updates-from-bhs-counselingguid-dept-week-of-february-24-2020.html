DEADLINE APRIL 15, 2020 - </strong>Civil discourse is a concept that goes beyond a simple dictionary definition, and understanding it involves a combination of personal experience and ‘big ideas.’ Perhaps it is something you recognize from an occurrence in your own life. Maybe you can easily recognize when it is missing. Differing perspectives are a key part of learning, of democracies, and of civil society. For this essay, we ask you not only share your comprehension of what civil discourse is meant to be but to also relate what it looks like when it works – and when it doesn’t – and why. Perhaps you will choose to include mention of a time when you, yourself, were part of an exchange intended to understand something – how did you go about it? We encourage you to bring emotion, creativity, specific examples (including current events), and well-researched facts into what you write. A good essay will demonstrate how civil discourse is not just an abstract idea, but is, in fact, action inspired by constitutional principles, and demonstrated through civic virtues. We want to know what you think civil discourse truly means.<br>The winners of this year’s contest will receive:<br>1st Place – $7,500 and a scholarship to our 2020 Constitutional Academy in Washington, D.C.Runners Up – 5 prizes at $1,500 eachHonorable Mentions – 8 prizes at $500 each<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579225303304000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GrnQJjZUt5CPBwHWSURZR">https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/</a><br><br><strong>UPDATED BHS Clubs/Organizations Info for students:</strong><br><strong><u>Interested in Medicine?

He will share an alternative approach that centers on identifying your students’ motivations. Students who pick the right schools “for them” will transition to college easier and experience greater success while there. Michael will also offer tips to parents about how to support their teens with meaningful, productive, values-based conversations throughout the college process. Our event will conclude with Q &amp; A. We encourage students to attend with their parents so they can continue the dialogue at home.<br>Michael holds a BA in history from Yale University and an MBA from the Harvard Business School.
