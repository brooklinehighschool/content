Today's excursion was pretty straight-forward: a day at the movies. Of course we had scheduled the warmest day so far (57 degrees F) to be indoors, but alas we can't control everything. The movie we chose was "La Vache", a heart-warming comedy about an Algerian man selected to participate in the "Salon de l'Agriculture" (the farmers' expo in Paris) in the category of "Best in Show" in the bovine category. The only problem: he had to cross the Mediterranean--with his cow!--and then walk--again, with his cow!--from Marseille to Paris. Those that, ahem, stayed awake, for the whole show really enjoyed the movie and I think our trip now has an official tag line: "C'est la faute à... LA POIRE!" You'll have to ask around about its meaning, but it's especially meaningful given that we're in Angers and its hinterland, the Anjou, which of course is famous for its... Anjou pears!
