                  <div class="paragraph">February 18th<br>This morning we set out on the bus to the Jozani Forest. And, after slipping on sunscreen and putting on our hats, we were ready to go. Though initially disappointed by the number of muzungus also out to see the jungle, the beauty of the forest quickly dissipated these sentiments. Once out of the bus, we walked soft jungle paths surrounded by walls of greenery. The trees towered over us like buildings in a city creating an uncharacteristically cool oasis under the canopy. It was even more stunning than I had imagined it would be, almost indescribable. The lushness of the forest was pristine as the park has grown untamed since 2005. But, as our tour guide told us, these plants and trees were so much more than just aesthetically pleasing. Along with their scientific names, our guide told us the medicinal purposes of the plants. Ranging from curing hiccups to inducing labor - the plants around us held more than the average pharmacy.<br>Then came the wildlife! We saw so many monkeys. We couldn’t touch them, but they were very calm and posed nicely for our photos. We also saw crabs running around the gnarled roots of the mangrove trees.<br><br>Once we said farewell to our tour guide, we were headed to the beach for a little R&amp;R. But getting there proved all but relaxing. The sun shone brightly, beating down on our shoulders as we struggled to find lunch (or our bus driver as he had dropped us off at the wrong resort). Luckily, I had my new wrap (not to be confused with the rap Mr. Kahrl did on the bus) which I turned into a makeshift sun shield. I got many a compliment on this innovative look.&nbsp;<em>Crunch, crunch, crunch.&nbsp;</em>Lunch was delicious! It was nice to have some fresh and crisp lettuce, a welcome change from pasta and sandwiches.<br>After lunch, we went out on the tidal banks, which turned out to be a muzungu idea since we got stranded as the water rose around us. It all ended well though as we floated back to shore on the current and over schools of fish and sea Urchins.<br>We had another magical dhow ride while the sun set. Once again, we jumped off the boat, this time in bathing suits. It’s important to note that not only did everyone jumped off the top deck today, but also that our tricks have improved, today brought dives and flips. I even got to help raise and lower the sails, and the owners of the boat so kindly promoted me to captain. We sailed into shore as the sun disappeared over the horizon, the perfect end to a perfect day.<br>- Emily<br></div>
