​In the Mexico City airport - flights were uneventful, customs line in Mexico City was long and boring, but poor Sra. Fuertes lost her luggage!  Here we're waiting while she deals with airport bureaucracy.  Good news!  Her suitcase has been located and is en route to Cuernavaca.

On the bus to our first excursion to Tezpotlán, a bustling tourist market town about 45 minutes outside of Cuernavaca.

Bug spray application before students make the trek up a mountain to see some ruins.  The verdict?  "Tepoztlán: the struggle." - Destiny.  "It was the hardest thing I've ever done." - Skye.  "Very, very hard.  We stopped very frequently." - Riley.  Welcome to Mexico!  Fortunately our other excursions will be less strenuous!
