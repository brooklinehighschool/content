Legislature was busy in the Winter and Spring of 2020! Before the COVID outbreak, Legislature passed 2 bills and during COVID, we kept meeting and passed another bill.  As well, Student Council and Legislature was the first group to survey en masse students to find out what problems they were experiencing during the remote learning in the spring of 2020. Those results were shared with administrators and led to direct action from teachers and administrators to change policies that were in place.    
  
Here are the 3 bills that pass last year:  
  
[Field Trip Absence Bill](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-OJTQsQ8L0d6y9zMiVmnPNADIlXmYGngzE79Z0fMhg/edit)  
"If a teacher takes their students on a class-sponsored field trip, those students will not receive absences for that class. A class-sponsored field trip is defined as any field trip that is endorsed by a teacher and is academically related to the course they teach that student. Additionally, if students go on a school-sponsored foreign exchange trip for a world language class, they will not receive absences in that world language class. This rule applies to all academic classes and electives, but not clubs. "  
  
[Right to Full Time to Complete Assignments Bill](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FmFJG9y73GlxSs2zzAF1Y5l-mcqWKZ2DMIdMMi_21Kg/edit)  
"Students will not be given late penalties for a nightly homework assignment that is submitted by the start time of the next class meeting. For example, if a student has homework assigned on Wednesday, but the class doesn’t meet again until Friday, the assignment cannot be due before the start of class on Friday. This does not apply to long term assignments."  
  
[Emergency Procedure Bill  
​](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DI4rOUkRVqAPnv_SUaHsSt30fJBORJsPKpBIpznGdU/edit)This bill was created to address how BHS Government will run if we every experience another unplanned school cancellation.
