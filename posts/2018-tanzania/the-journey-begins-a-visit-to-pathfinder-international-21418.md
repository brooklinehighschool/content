What an incredible first day. Wow  
  
We were all awoken by the call to prayer at about 5:20, as our hotel happens to be right next to the local mosque. After some of us managed to go back to sleep, we all went to breakfast: a combination of American and Tanzanian cuisine.  
  
We then all piled into two vans to go to the Pathfinder International office of Dar Es Salaam. We were met with a very gracious welcome. All of the staff gathered with us around a large table, and introduced themselves one-by-one. The country director, Joseph, talked about the amazing projects that  Pathfinder International is currently working on in Tanzania. He also included some shocking statistics:  
  
54% of Tanzania’s 50 million population is under the age of 20.  
The average age of first time mothers in 19.  
The population is expected to double in size by 2050.  
  
Pathfinder has opened numerous family planning clinics, youth centers, and launched campaigns against domestic violence.  
  
After a quick tour of the office, we split into two groups to go out “into the field”. My group went to the Tabata Family Planning clinic in West Dar Es Salaam. The main doctor of the clinic greeted us and told us about the successes and challenges the clinic has met since its opening. Since the opening, there have been less referrals to the local hospital, as the clinic is equipped to treat non-emergent cases. We had the opportunity to talk to staff from every section of the clinic. We talked to the health care providers, who showed us all of the contraceptive methods they offer. We also talked to the post abortion care team. Abortion is not legal in Tanzania, so women find illegal and unsafe ways to self-induce abortion. This part of the clinic helps women after an abortion is attempted. The main health care provider pulled out all of the equipment for a manu -vacu-aspiration, and demonstrates how it worked using both a vaginal model and a water bottle. It was incredible that she took the time out of her schedule to show us exactly how they help women every day. We then went to the labor unit. Unfortunately, all the laboring moms had been discharged for the day; however, we were able to tour where the babies are delivered and kept before discharge. We learned that women usually deliver and leave in the same day, as Tabata only delivers non-emergent cases. Finally, we sat down and talked to the Community Health Workers who go out into the community to bring women into the clinic for contraception. The group of women told us that they often face resistance from religious families, people who believe rumors that contraception leads to cancer, or families who are adamant about sticking to their traditional birth control methods.  
  
After we took some pictures and thanked the staff for taking time out of their incredibly busy day, we headed off to the market with Pathfinder staff. We arrived at a bustling food market, where vendors shouted energetically. As we walked by, many of the people jokingly yelled “mzungu”, meaning white person. People seemed to be fascinated by our visit, wanting to take pictures, or with one man, wanting to propose marriage in return for an entire cart of tomatoes.  
  
After the staff finished their food shopping, we headed to a more touristy market. Some of us managed to hone our bartering skills to get the best deals on animal print pants and canvas paintings. We headed back to the hotel before dinner, and some of us were able to squeeze in a quick nap.  
  
We hopped in the van to a restaurant to meet all the Pathfiner staff we had met earlier that morning. After some delicious juice, we had a buffet-style Tanzanian cuisine dinner. Mr. Kahrl encouraged us to interact with staffs members, so we each sat alternating with staff. The woman I sat next to told me all about how she got into Pathfinder International. We also got to ask her for recommendations for our trip to Zanzibar. She, along with everyone else we talked to, said going swimming in the ocean was a must. I also sat near a little boy named, Benny, who told us all about how he loves Justin Bieber.  
  
With one last round of thank-you’s and pictures, we headed back to our hotel for some much-needed sleep.  
  
It is absolutely crazy to think this was only day one. Cannot wait for tomorrow...

The other group had the chance to visit a family planning consultation area during our time at the clinic where we saw a procedure room for IUD insertions. We were all amazed and a little terrified as a nurse pulled out the tools involved with IUDs from a menacing looking measuring device for the uterus to a speculum. The entire group erupted into laughter as the nurses used different body parts to model the process, from their own fists to their heads. Their enthusiasm and determination for us to understand their passion made the process enjoyable and engaging. As we left the building, we passed a young women who was entering the procedure room and one of the pathfinder employees explained that she was about to undergo the process we just learned about. She then asked if anyone would like to observe, and we all laughed, believing that she was poking fun at our astonished reactions. Once we realized that this was a serious offer, I raised my hand. I waited in the office for a moment while she checked with the patient to see if they were okay with an observer, and then she ushered me into the room, leaving me alone with two nurses and the young woman. I quietly shrank into the back corner unacknowledged and watched as the nurse explained how the process would work, and then did a series of arm raises that I later learned was to check for masses in her breasts. As soon as the nurses began the procedure, they waved me over, saying that I couldn’t possibly see from all the way over there. I slowly inched closer until one of the nurses finally pointed to a spot a foot behind them and told me exactly where I could stand. Now with an unobstructed view about two feet from patient, they began to talk me through what they were doing as they measured out her uterus to size the device correctly, inserted the IUD and then finished by swabbing the cervix to check for cervical cancer. The entire process took about ten minutes, and at the end, I graciously thanked the nurses for letting me have this opportunity and then stepped out to rejoin the group
