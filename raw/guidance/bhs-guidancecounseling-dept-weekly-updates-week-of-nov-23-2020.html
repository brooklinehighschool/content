                  <div class="paragraph">​This is a short school week with Thanksgiving happening this Thursday. The school schedule will remain as is with Mon, Tues, and the ½ day Wed schedules unchanged. Only hybrid students in the Mon/Tues cohort will be coming in-person this short week. Please see attached schedules for OLS and 115 for reminders about blocks, including ½ day Wednesday blocks.<br><strong>Happy and Safe Thanksgiving to all!</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>While the focus of Back to School Night #2 onThursday 11/12 was on the classrooms and teacher messages, the BHS counselors and social workers wanted to introduce themselves too! The videos from these dedicated and caring student support educators from BHS are available below on our blog.</strong><br><br>Please note that generally referrals to BHS social workers should be requested through a student’s counselor or dean. Social workers are excellent resources for BHS students AND have very large caseloads at this time, especially this year with the more heightened level of mental health needs in our world. While they would love to have more availability, they are not always able to meet weekly with every student who may ask for this support.<br>​<br>We encourage families to seek out mental health resources through the Brookline Center or their own health insurance programs. If a student or family needs assistance with this step, please feel free to contact the student’s counselor or one of the BHS social workers.&nbsp;</div>

Walk-ins are also available. The testing program will run now until Dec. 31.<br>Testing will be conducted outdoors in tents in the Health Department parking lot at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1eBm5fPiRzg7NfSE9">11 Pierce Street</a>, while weather permits. Testing will then be moved inside to the Denny Room, located on the lower level of the Brookline Department of Public Health Building, accessed through the Harvard Street entrance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Testing is available for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, however, only the costs for those displaying symptoms will be processed through the patients’ health insurance provider. Asymptomatic and uninsured individuals will be required to pay $140. Asymptomatic individuals who seek testing may request reimbursement for the expense through their insurance company.<br>We are hopeful that this testing site will provide a convenience for parents, students, and staff to undergo timely testing when symptoms develop, to identify positive cases quickly, as well as to allow for a quick return to school when tests are negative and symptoms have resolved.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To facilitate contact tracing within the schools, staff or students who live outside of Brookline must sign a consent form allowing the test results to be sent directly to the Department of Brookline Public Health, in addition to the health department of the individual’s home residence.<br>&nbsp;<br>School nurses will continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Brookline Public Health to identify close contacts of positive cases within the school setting.&nbsp; An individual’s local board of health will continue to manage the positive cases of their community. This partnership allows for a quicker review of close contacts within the school system and determination of school attendance.<br>&nbsp;<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information about the Town of Brookline’s ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, visit <a href="https://brooklinecovid19.com/">BrooklineCOVID19.com</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Reminder - Free breakfast and lunch items are available for FREE for ANY STUDENT in the school district for the remainder of the school year. </strong>If your student needs a breakfast or lunch, have them stop by the cafe at either 115 or OLS.

If you’re helping your child with remote learning at the same time you’re on a work call, you can’t go for a run or turn on your favorite music. Instead:<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try a few of the breathing exercises listed on<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/9GdhCR651nuQkzXnT9NM3Q?domain=sites.google.com"> 10/5</a>&nbsp;<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do a couple of body stretches&nbsp;<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shake out your hands, arms, legs to release tension,&nbsp;<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consciously release your jaw<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Literally shift your focus: If you’re feeling stressed, turn away from whatever you’re doing (computer screen, your child or partner) if only for a couple of seconds, and shift your gaze. This can be enough to disrupt the cycle<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take one task at a time as much as possible to avoid overwhelm, knowing that sometimes we need to power through difficult situations in the best ways we can.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Brookline Center is offering new support groups for children and adolescents - </strong>&nbsp;- <strong>There will be NO groups November 23 - 27.
