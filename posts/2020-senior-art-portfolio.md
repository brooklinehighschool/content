2020 Senior Art Portfolio Online Exhibition
-------------------------------------------

In tumultuous times society always looks to its artists and creative designers to notice, reflect, heal, connect with others, and envision new possibilities in an ever-changing world. The class of 2020 has faced some challenging times - they have had to think flexibly, act responsibly, and learn differently as they wend their way toward the end of their time at BHS.  Through all of this, the student artists at BHS  have continued to engage with creative work because that is what artists do - it is how they think.   
  
This online exhibit features the work of eight seniors from the AP Art and Design class.  This year, they have been engaged in individually designed inquiry learning projects as they follow their own curiosity about ideas, materials, and processes to create a series of related works.  Each artist exhibiting their work has written an artist's statement to frame your experience of encountering their work and as you investigate each artist's exhibition page you will find a wide variety of work all of which is deeply personal and reflective of students' individual experiences in this world.   
  
Please Note:The work in this exhibit would not have come to fruition with out the nurturing, guidance, and feedback of the entire visual arts department.  We all had a hand in teaching these students, helping them to develop their skills, and encouraging them to find their individual creative voice.
