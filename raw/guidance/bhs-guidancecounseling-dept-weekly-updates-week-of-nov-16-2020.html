Walk-ins are also available. The testing program will run now until Dec. 31.<br>Testing will be conducted outdoors in tents in the Health Department parking lot at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1eBm5fPiRzg7NfSE9">11 Pierce Street</a>, while weather permits. Testing will then be moved inside to the Denny Room, located on the lower level of the Brookline Department of Public Health Building, accessed through the Harvard Street entrance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Testing is available for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, however, only the costs for those displaying symptoms will be processed through the patients’ health insurance provider. Asymptomatic and uninsured individuals will be required to pay $140. Asymptomatic individuals who seek testing may request reimbursement for the expense through their insurance company.<br>We are hopeful that this testing site will provide a convenience for parents, students, and staff to undergo timely testing when symptoms develop, to identify positive cases quickly, as well as to allow for a quick return to school when tests are negative and symptoms have resolved.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To facilitate contact tracing within the schools, staff or students who live outside of Brookline must sign a consent form allowing the test results to be sent directly to the Department of Brookline Public Health, in addition to the health department of the individual’s home residence.<br>&nbsp;<br>School nurses will continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Brookline Public Health to identify close contacts of positive cases within the school setting.&nbsp; An individual’s local board of health will continue to manage the positive cases of their community. This partnership allows for a quicker review of close contacts within the school system and determination of school attendance.<br><br>

If you’re helping your child with remote learning at the same time you’re on a work call, you can’t go for a run or turn on your favorite music.

This can be enough to disrupt the cycle<br>· Take one task at a time as much as possible to avoid overwhelm, knowing that sometimes we need to power through difficult situations in the best ways we can.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Brookline Center is offering new support groups for children and adolescents - </strong>&nbsp;- see attached flyers for more information <strong>:&nbsp;</strong>
