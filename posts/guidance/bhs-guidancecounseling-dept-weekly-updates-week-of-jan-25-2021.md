SWS Admissions Info Packet  
Please take the opportunity to see if SWS could be a good fit.  
   
School Within a School, located on the fourth floor of BHS, is an alternative, democratic community for a diverse group of approximately 120 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Goals for students include taking as much responsibility for their education as possible, sharing decision-making in running SWS, and contributing to building a caring community. For 50 years, SWS has provided students with the opportunity to participate actively as leaders in their own educations and develop meaningful relationships with teachers based on mutual respect. Admission to SWS is based on a lottery, the criteria of which are determined by the SWS Town Meeting. In addition to Town Meeting, SWS students take at least two classes in the program, including English. They take the rest of their classes in the mainstream of BHS. More information about the program, and the admissions process, can be found at swsbrookline.org.

**Brookline Cares - Empowerment Coats winter drive**  
Brookline Cares is a student-run, volunteer organization started by Brookline High School students. Our organization promotes awareness, fundraises, and accepts donations of winter clothing to donate to people in need. The clothing collected is given to people in communities with high rates of COVID-19 in the Greater Boston area. We are urgently raising money through a GoFundMe to purchase Empowerment coats to give out to people in communities with high rates of COVID. These communities also have high rates of poverty and homelessness. Empowerment coats are coats that convert into sleeping bags and can be used by people experiencing homelessness or people who do not have shelter.  Visit their website for more information: [https://www.empowermentplan.org/the-coat](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/LAEOCxk715uBlz17t8FsFF?domain=empowermentplan.org). The coats will be distributed by Mass General to people in Revere, Chelsea, Lynn, Charlestown, and Everett through their mobile testing vans. If you want to help make a positive difference in the world we live in, then this is the perfect cause to donate to.

**JUNIORS and SENIORS**  
**Are you a junior or senior (or parent/guardian of a junior or senior) with diagnosed learning differences? Want to gain understanding about how student support and accommodations are handled differently in college than high school?** BHS Guidance and Special Education will come together to share a great panel on this topic in March  (details TBD). We have also gotten information about an good overview presentation on this topic from Westfield State College. Here are more details below plus please see the attached flyer for registration to one of these presentations still happening from Jan 25-27:  
Preparing for college is process. It includes learning how to be an independent learner, advocate for one self and how to improve your academic skills continuously. Students with disabilities going to college should understand that they will be expected to perform – and will be assessed – in the same manner as their peers. There are other considerations, among them are:  
   
·       What sorts of reasonable accommodations are available?  
·       How do I request reasonable accommodations?  
·       What sort of documentation do I need to receive accommodations?  
·       Why doesn’t my IEP or 504 plan follow me to college?  
·       What steps can I take now to be college ready?  
·       What is the level of parents’ involvement in college?  
   
Westfield State University’s Banacos Academic Center is hosting hour-long Zoom sessions to address these very questions for high school students and their parents or guardians.  Disability/Accessibility Services staff from the other Massachusetts Universities and a Westfield State Admissions representative will be present.  Please use this form to sign up for a session. Sessions are capped at 50 sign ups.   
   
One-hour long sessions available from January 14 – 27 (see flyer for dates and times)
