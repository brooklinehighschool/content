Junior Leadership
-----------------

* * *

**Junior Representatives and Ambassadors for the 2019-2020 school year    
​**  
The Junior Reps program is an evolution of the Junior Mentorship program focused on creating a welcoming environment for all incoming BHS students across the campus. Ambassadors work directly with international students to support their transition to BHS.  
  
Junior leaders must have a desire to:

*   Ensure every student feels known.
*   Communicate the culture and develop the community of BHS.
*   Foster mutual respect and appreciation of others through good citizenship.
*   Demonstrate the practice and consequences of “freedom and responsibility”.
*   Promote the emotional well-being of students.

  
**JUNIOR REPS:** We need to fill approximately 60 Junior Reps positions. We are looking for students who have a specific set of qualities that would make them best suited for these important roles.  We are looking for applicants who are able to make all students feel welcome, be friendly, engaged and a model citizen, and participate in any activity with enthusiasm. Junior Reps commit to attending several events throughout the year both during and outside of school hours including but not limited to:

*   Opening day(s) of school, orientation, etc., including the 1st day for freshman as well as the 2nd day for all students.  
*   Orienting new 10th-12th graders.  
*   Several Night Events - Back to School Night (Fall), 8th grade Elective Night (Winter/Spring), 8th-grade Curriculum Night (Winter/Spring)
*   Student tours for potential transfer students
*   Student recruitment events for clubs
*   Student panels for class assemblies 

                 
**AMBASSADORS:** We are looking for 20-25 Ambassadors who are a select group of diverse students committed to helping new international students integrate into life at BHS. Ambassadors are involved in activities such as planning events, giving tours, welcoming new students and their families, matching up with individual students, assisting students in ELE classrooms, and helping new students adjust to new surroundings. The roles and responsibilities of the Ambassadors occur on a more irregular basis (e.g. more activities during the first semester), but Ambassadors are still integral to making our school a welcoming place throughout the year. Your willingness to help and your comfort level facing new situations are important criteria for this important responsibility.  
  
We are interested in recruiting a diverse group of students.  Your leadership, charisma, and level of responsibility are the most important qualities for consideration. If you think you possess all or most of the qualities listed in this letter, please consider applying to become a Junior Rep or Ambassador.  Attached you will find a list of important dates and the application for these jobs.  We look forward to reading your application and working with you if you are chosen.
