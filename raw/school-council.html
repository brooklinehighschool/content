                <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><strong>What is a school council and why are they required? </strong><br>A school council is a representative school building-based committee composed of the principal, parents, teachers, and community members and, at the grade 9 to 12 level, students. School councils are required to be established by each school pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 71, Section 59C.<br><br>School councils are a means of promoting the educational benefits of site-based decision making for every school in Massachusetts. With teachers, parents and community members working together, the school council supports school-based planning and goal setting for school improvements. The expanded participation of the school community in school improvement helps to provide the school with different and mutually complementary perspectives on its goals and improvements.<br><br><strong>What do school councils do? What are their main areas of responsibility?</strong><br>The primary responsibility of the school council is to advise and assist the Headmaster with the School Improvement Plan (SIP) and to help develop any projects arising out of the SIP that the Headmaster identifies as beneficial to the successful functioning and development of the school.<br><br>The school council meets each month during the academic year.&nbsp; As mandated by the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law, school council meetings are open to the public who are invited to attend and speak before the council regarding school-wide issues only. The council does not address any issues regarding individual students and therefore any public address regarding any individual student is not deemed appropriate and will not be heard.<br><br>An agenda for each meeting is posted on the town website calendar in advance, and minutes of each meeting are posted as soon as possible on this website.&nbsp; See agendas, meeting dates, and minutes below.</div>
