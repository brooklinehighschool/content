**Important message to seniors who have applied for EA/ED October/November applications – Please try to avoid INCs or need for grade changes for Quarter 1.** The turnaround time for the guidance office to send out all Quarter 1 grades for early appliers is very short before all staff head out for Thanksgiving break in November.  
**Also for students applying Early Decision- It is your responsibility to notify your counselor about your ED contract** and remind the counselor to sign off on your contract. When you hear back with the college ED decision, please also inform your counselor. We cannot send any grades to other colleges until we know your ED contract no longer applies (ie you did not get accepted to your ED school).  
   
**All Seniors Seminars have now been offered in your advisories since mid-September. If you missed these advisory overviews, please contact your counselor or Lenny Libenzon, BHS College Counselor – room 279/280, for a copy of the BHS College Application Quick Guide and other important details to help you follow the steps for a successful application process.**

Check your Naviance homepage or stop by the College-Career Center Room 279 for a full listing of all reps and the date/time they will be available in the College-Career Center to meet you! You must have a signed pass from your teacher if you plan to attend during one of your classes. See Mr Libenzon (Room 279/280) or your counselor if you have any questions.

**UPDATE**:  If you have college applications with **Nov 1 or Nov 15 deadlines – your transcript release form and other important documents are now overdue**. Counselors and department staff are working hard during and outside of the school day to get your documents ready for these deadlines. **If you got your completed transcript release to your counselor by BHS deadlines and did FERPA and “matching” steps with your Naviance and Common App accounts, then we will meet your deadlines.
