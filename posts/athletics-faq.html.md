### [When is the equipment room open?](javascript:toggleLayer('FAQ3');)

It is sometimes possible but...

Students have a variety of graduation requirements.  If students are interested in taking more than one language, they need to discuss its long-term scheduling implications with their guidance counselor.  World Languages do not count as elective courses, and therefore cannot be substituted for Career Ed, Visual Arts, or Performing Arts.

In addition, students might have other needs such as Tutorial which might restrict their ability to add an extra world language.

Finally, BHS needs to consider its budgetary needs.  There might be years when we cannot offer two world languages, and students will need to choose between the two.

### [Why isn't there more media of my team?](javascript:toggleLayer('FAQ4');)

The Athletic Department relies upon parents, players, and coaches to submit media and game reports.  We love to share information about all our teams on Twitter (@BHS\_Warriors) and Instagram (@BrooklineAthletics); however, we cannot attend every event.  Please share photos, videos, and game stories via email with Mr. Rittenburg or Mr. Williams.
