BHS educators and support staff have missed the students. They are prepared to do their best to offer enticing, engaging, and caring academic activities and support to the student community. As a principal at Gorham HS in Maine wrote, <em>“This is about relationships and community and supporting one another to do the best we can with what we have. &nbsp;If at the end of all this, when we finally set things back up straight again – [if a student] didn't do this and this, we will figure that all out together. &nbsp;NO ONE IS GOING TO PUNISH OUR STUDENTS for doing the best they can. &nbsp;No one is going to punish our families for doing the best they can. &nbsp;No one is going to punish our schools or our community for doing the best we can”.&nbsp;</em><br><br>Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/12jnIU2LeaDsd5MI01PdH6Q-5ux7SyNQU9UTh6AM9LRw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">check out the guidance page</a> on the United Minds platform. We are here to help and support every BHS student!<br><br><strong><u>The student portal will be open until March 31 for all Gr 9-11 BHS students to upload their elective and wellness course selections</u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong>Be sure students can access their portal now since students only can be uploading these courses to their student portal!</strong></div>

Keep in mind the required BHS course credits needed for graduation and talk with your parents-caretakers about the best course load balance for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Thoughts for Gr 9 students &amp; parents-caretakers</strong> from educator Matt Malatesta (Vice President for Admissions, Financial Aid and Enrollment at Union College in New York):<br>“Kids need to know how to learn, to challenge themselves, to live a balanced life, to have fun – not how to get into college or a particular college. Strong colleges and universities across the country are interested in enrolling students from a variety of educational backgrounds and with different levels of academic achievement. Admission is not the goal or the endgame. The more important question for our children is,’Are you ready to stretch yourself and continue to grow once in college?’”<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Thoughts for Gr 10 students &amp; parents-caretakers</strong> from the author in his prologue: “Colleges features, images, and ‘brands’ are seductive. This is by design. But the images too often are limited to the sensory and struggle to get to the heart of the matter. Before our kids make their college choice or even begin the process, they need to understand first what makes them tick. ‘Who am I? What do I expect? What do I value most? What do I need?’ Parents play a significant role in guiding them to that self-understanding.”<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Thoughts for Gr 11 students &amp; parents-caretakers</strong> from the author in his prologue: “The lesson was clear: many paths, and often detours, can lead to success… More than half of all students will change majors at least once. Our children will not always get what they (or we) want, and they many not follow the straightest or simplest path, but that’s not always a bad thing. Encourage your child to chart their course and own their college search and choice process. Admission is not a grade on parenting.”<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Thoughts for Gr 12 students &amp; parents-caretakers</strong> from the author in the section called Fit and highlighting the price tag of colleges: As the author advised his own son about making choices between colleges he’d been accepted to, “[his son] wrestled with two choices, both schools that matched his interests and aspirations very well. In many ways, the schools were similar, but the incremental difference in net price was substantial: one school would have cost our family well over $100,000 more over 4 years than the other…. [We] asked him, ‘Could you tell us why you think this school is worth that much more than the other?’ … I knew he’d struggle with an answer. In the end, he chose the smaller price tag not because it cost less but rather because he could not (nor could I) define enough difference or value to warrant paying the higher price. Had the 2 finalists been different, where the value of the one clearly exceeded the value of the other, he perhaps would have made a different choice. He learned, as did I, that value is relative.”<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>3rd Quarter IPRs (Interim Progress Reports) were issued on the student and parent portals on Friday 3/13. Students should be using this time to make up any work that is allowed by their teachers before school closure, along with completing activities suggested by their teachers on the United Minds platform. Students should contact their teacher directly if they have any questions and teachers will answer to their best ability.</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Please read the articles below:<br>- Relevance of trade careers for many young people, including some of our Brookline High students-<br><u><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.familycircle.com/teen/teens-need-know-they-can-make-money-trade-careers/?utm_source%3Dfacebook.com%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-share-article%26utm_content%3D20200108&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582920291216000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dz0m3GP5eh7bZ3X5yAQgV">https://www.familycircle.com/teen/teens-need-know-they-can-make-money-trade-careers/?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social-share-article&amp;utm_content=20200108</a></u>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Colleges of some well-known people -&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/hfGFCBBR6psP4vO0Fz_mqs?domain%3Dlookaside.fbsbx.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1583428168898000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CM3YEZv_1hKDlEq3raqqm">https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/file/Successful people and the college they attended.pptx?token=AWzzoGAKLvTON0lW9oFO4bV5CbihZ8bNLJr40yWlQcFGgVzShNV_LDmYeWJsvcNcXLI0eVsdHlIFq3MOhU3iofJT171oWkAI8eza9Vw0l79NV0245McBCjez7F3lmgYRd1d9m9jkH2zzcflFPzUsKssh_OkGp8yswF_tnddnEXh1Zslu6LPeSLuzVwwu4t7VqxS4ExlfDtbgNgF88czIwgsE</a><br><br><br><strong>It's time to think about your summer plans!</strong>&nbsp;<br>Please see the attached info sheet for many ideas (updated 3/8/20).

DEADLINE APRIL 15, 2020 - </strong>Civil discourse is a concept that goes beyond a simple dictionary definition, and understanding it involves a combination of personal experience and ‘big ideas.’ Perhaps it is something you recognize from an occurrence in your own life. Maybe you can easily recognize when it is missing. Differing perspectives are a key part of learning, of democracies, and of civil society. For this essay, we ask you not only share your comprehension of what civil discourse is meant to be but to also relate what it looks like when it works – and when it doesn’t – and why. Perhaps you will choose to include mention of a time when you, yourself, were part of an exchange intended to understand something – how did you go about it? We encourage you to bring emotion, creativity, specific examples (including current events), and well-researched facts into what you write. A good essay will demonstrate how civil discourse is not just an abstract idea, but is, in fact, action inspired by constitutional principles, and demonstrated through civic virtues. We want to know what you think civil discourse truly means.<br>The winners of this year’s contest will receive:<br>1st Place – $7,500 and a scholarship to our 2020 Constitutional Academy in Washington, D.C.Runners Up – 5 prizes at $1,500 eachHonorable Mentions – 8 prizes at $500 each<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579225303304000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GrnQJjZUt5CPBwHWSURZR">https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/</a><br><strong>** </strong><strong>GROW&nbsp;(Greater Boston Research Opportunities for Young Women)&nbsp;</strong><br>•&nbsp;Dates: June 25-26 (orientation)&nbsp;and July 6– August 14, 2020 M-F from 9:30-4:30&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Grade Level: Young women from greater Boston high schools who will be entering their senior year in fall 2020<br>•&nbsp;Must be 16 years old by July 1, 2020<br>•&nbsp;Must live within 30 miles and be able to commute to BU every day<br>•&nbsp;Deadline for Applications: &nbsp;April 15, 2020<br><br>GROW&nbsp;is a six-week paid research internship for young women who are seriously interested in STEM careers.
