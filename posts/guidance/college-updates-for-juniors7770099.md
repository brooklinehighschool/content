Dear Juniors,  
  
The College Board is canceling the June SAT administration.  Please read the update from the College Board below:  
  
“Right now, public health officials have made clear it is not safe to gather students in one place. Many states have closed school for the rest of the academic year, and globally there are widespread school closures across 192 countries. **As such, we will not be able to administer the SAT and SAT Subject Tests as planned on June 6, 2020****.** Students will have opportunities to take the SAT to make up for this spring’s lost administrations. If it’s safe from a public health standpoint, we will provide weekend SAT administrations every month through the end of the calendar year, beginning in August. This includes a new administration in September and the previously scheduled tests on August 29, October 3, November 7, and December 5.Students will be able to register for these administrations beginning in May. We’ll communicate directly with students when the exact date is available. Students who were registered for June and those in the high school class of 2021 who do not have SAT scores will have early access to registration for the August, September, and October administrations.”

Coalition College Fair:  The Coalition Application is hosting a [Virtual College Fair](http://www.coalitionforcollege.org/april-2020-virtual-fair.html), featuring 44 Coalition for College member schools on Thursday, April 23. The list of schools includes many of the schools that are popular with our graduates.  This online fair will include two panel discussions: “Tips on Creating Your College List” and “Behind the Scenes: How Admissions Decisions Are Made.” Then, students can join virtual rooms, where admissions officers will share information about their college and answer students' questions.  [www.coalitionforcollege.org/april-2020-virtual-fair.html](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/8c3TCW6jqvuyKwyptnYlS9?domain=mx.technolutions.net)  
  
Excellent admissions advice: Please read [this very supportive letter](http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2020/04/02/being-seen-this-one-is-for-the-juniors/) from an admissions representative from Georgia Tech
