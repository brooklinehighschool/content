Does a school culture of comparison add more stress and anxiety to our community? Is there a benefit to this culture? Do we want to change it? How do we support students to celebrate their post high school plans – no matter the college, community college, gap year, job, military next step - without feeling badly about what is the best fit for each individual?

**JUNIORS**  
   
Please finish this step before you leave for summer vacation!-  
It’s time to complete and turn in **your Brag Sheet (parents/guardians) and Junior Questionnaire (students)**. This information was shared with all juniors during seminars in February and March, also included in students’ junior seminar packets. Counselors request that these forms be returned to their offices by June 2019. Your cooperation supports counselors having details to write their counselor recommendation writing for college applications.  
Thse documents are located on the BHS Guidance website and will be attached to the weekly guidance update email to each student.
