		3/7/2021
	

Could spring be in the air? With area temperatures possibly climbing into the 60’s this week and Daylight Savings Time happening next Sunday 3/14, we could all use some more sun and spring vibes.  
   
Five important guidance related messages and events are highlighted here:

*   Almost everyone’s mental health has been affected this past year. Be sure to take some time to read recent messages from BHS. (This information is also listed below and attached to this email.) Take the time to take care of yourself too! 

*   Students in Grades 9-11 will begin to add their course requests for 2021-22 into their student portals starting this Tues 3/9 through 3/30.  As courses are considered, school and life BALANCE for each student is key. Students should have heard from their teachers regarding course level recommendations. They also should be aware of what credits they need to earn a BHS diploma by their graduation. The STUDENT PORTAL will allow students to upload elective and wellness courses. The 2021-22 BHS Course Catalog is now [available on the BHS homepage](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/) .
*   For Class of 2022 – BHS Guidance will be sponsoring its first [Virtual College Fair](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance/bhs-virtual-college-fair) this Wednesday 3/10 from 6:30-8:30pm. Information has been shared in other emails and [is also listed here](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/guidance/bhs-virtual-college-fair).

There will be 2 IPRs (progress reports) for this Quarter 3. The first IPR are scheduled to be posted to student and parent portals tomorrow Monday 3/8. Please be sure to review this information. It’s great to validate academic successes and to provide constructive problemsolving with your student in areas of challenge. Have your student reach out to their teachers and available academic supports if needed.    
  
​This week is another special schedule week. Friday 3/12 will be a ½ day for BHS students with classes ending at 12:30pm so staff can participate in afternoon professional development.  See the schedule attached to this email.

**Mental health Supports:**  
**It’s been a year of pandemic challenges. Brookline High Head of School Anthony Meyer and Coordinator of Guidance and Couneling Darby Neff-Verre shared a letter last week to remind families of the social/emotional/mental health supports and resources available at BHS and in the Brookline vicinity. In addition, BHS School Psychologist Matt DuBois coordinated a detailed overview of signs and symptoms of red flags for mental health concerns. Please be sure to read these communications and do not hesitate to ask for help if you are concerned. See those communications attached to this email as well.**  
   
**Also for parents/caregivers – Need some support right now?**  
**BRYT Central is offering free** **Parents Supporting Parents** **groups open to all caregivers.** See attached flyer for details.  
Don’t worry alone!  
**Students - Feeling down? Always anxious or worried? Concerned about someone else in your life – friend, family member? Not sleeping well because your mind can’t shut down? If these questions sound familiar, please talk to a trusted adult at home or in school.**  
**Guidance/school counselors and other clinical support staff at Brookline High are here to listen, assess, and support you so you are not carrying these burdens alone.** **Please reach out to your counselor. You can also reach out to a BHS faculty member (including Darby Neff-Verre – Coordinator of BHS Guidance/Counseling) to start the conversation about how we can help you build strategies or get connected to feel safe and better about your situation. Contact your counselor at their email, zoom visiting hours, or phone.**

**Interested in applying to Framingham State University? You have a great opportunity to get accepted on the spot at Framingham State University**…. Join FSU and BHS for a Virtual Admissions Decision Day. Register to meet with an FSU admissions representative to discuss your application and receive your decision (please note, in some cases FSU will not be able to provide a decision at the time of meeting, but will let you know what your next steps are. Application fees will be waived for participating applicants). Here are the steps:  
**1)** [Make an appointment](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/NbaHCv29Z5u4kyN0cQlTs-?domain=admissions.framingham.edu) for the zoom session. Important: this will be a zoom meeting with the FSU Admissions Counselor who makes the admission decisions.  Please come on time & represent BHS well.  
**2)** Complete [Commonapp.org](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/BI3PCwpRr5cPwR8Zfqyskm?domain=commonapp.org/)  for FSU, or [FSU’s own application](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/kPbGCxk715uBWQMqcYrfXL?domain=admissions.framingham.edu/). Framingham State does not require an essay. To get the fee waiver, there is a question on both the FSU App, and then on the Common App (in the FSU questions) that asks if you are eligible for a school specific waiver. Select "official campus visit." It's okay if you submit the app before the meeting, once the meeting takes place FSU will make sure the app fee is waived.  
**3)** Complete the [transcript release form](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/KGPBCyPJX5uJByXmTRFtlg?domain=forms.gle), & email Mr. Libenzon ([lenny\_libenzon@psbma.org](mailto:lenny_libenzon@psbma.org)) to indicate that you will attend the on-the-spot session.
