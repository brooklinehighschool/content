The BHS Counseling/Guidance department and the school community continues to encourage students to try their best in school while keeping their stress levels as low as possible. These COVID19 challenges continue to test our patience, our anxiety about the unknown, and our strength. The MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE CONTINUES TO BE THE IMPORTANCE OF **TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF.  REACH OUT IF YOU NEED SUPPORT! BHS COUNSELORS AND OTHER STAFF ARE HERE FOR YOU… AT A DISTANCE BUT WITH AS MUCH CARE AS EVER! PLEASE DO NOT WORRY ALONE.  
**

The Boston Globe wants to hear from high school students:  
Reporters from the Boston Globe's investigative team for education and inequality - The Great Divide - are hosting weekly virtual town halls to create space for students to share their experiences, connect with peers, pose questions to an adult support network. To stay in the know, students can join our text line by sending STUDENT to 1-833-335-2777 or by signing up for our free newsletter at [globe.com/thegreatdivide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/lZz3CZ6m0yuoNgXpszXLKl?domain%3Dglobe.com&sa=D&ust=1587868095307000&usg=AOvVaw36670ybZ1Q_cYMCSA2KoWW).  
  
Eyal Arkin, David Carmel, Anat Katz, Noah Schwartz, Benja Rosenzweig, Liam Smolyar - BHS students - working in combination with several other BHS students, has created a **web-based service to take, purchase, and deliver grocery orders for people who are not able to get to the grocery store themselves (primarily the elderly and the immunocompromised)**.  The website lists the current team and a link for others to join them, provides a way to order, explains how the team is complying with sanitary measures and cleanliness, and provides a page of other resources.  Here is the link: [https://projectdriveway.org/home](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/4MZUCyPJX5uy5zAOHZe4Y9?domain%3Dprojectdriveway.org&sa=D&ust=1587169040811000&usg=AOvVaw07lS0w6p6n2UIDLy6q5fTQ) If you know of anyone who might be in need of this service please consider sending this to them or publicizing this in some way.

Help your Brookline neighbor! See this message from **Brookline Strength in Distance** - We are a small group of Brookline-ites who got together to create the “Strength in Distance” fundraiser to support the Brookline Food Pantry. The food pantry receives and distributes more than 12,000 pounds of fresh produce, frozen items, dry goods, and hygiene products to our neighbors EACH WEEK and has just opened a third location to help meet demand.   
In order to ensure that all of us have the food we need to stay healthy and strong during this crisis, the Food Pantry needs your help! Please visit [brooklinestrengthindistance.com](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/LVTICL95JDiYB6w4iqICpT?domain=brooklinestrengthindistance.com) to purchase a “Strength in Distance” t-shirt to support the Brookline Food Pantry as well as a local print shop. Or, if you prefer, you can donate directly to the Brookline Food Pantry or the Brookline Community Foundation’s Safety Net Fund (linked on our site).   
If you know any students, friends or fellow community members who are in need of support in these difficult and uncertain times, please visit the [Brookline Mutual Aid Google Doc](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/WDKKCKr5QBsr7VMmfM1kUB?domain=docs.google.com) to get plugged into Brookline’s community services network. Feel free to send this message to other Brookline community members as well!

**SENIORS**  
   
**Deans Redding, Alexander, and Poon said it well – We celebrate you from our quarantine homes!**  
Dear Seniors,  
By now we are sure that you have heard that Governor Baker announced today that all schools in Massachusetts will remain closed for the remainder of the school year.  Even though we were not surprised by this announcement, it hit us hard. Not gonna lie: we shed some tears.    
Our hearts go out to you. We imagine that you may feel a range of emotions -- anger, disappointment, sadness, despondency, indifference...all are valid.   
As you process your reactions, please know that we are soliciting ideas as well as convening groups of staff, parents, and students who will plan aspects of Graduation 2020 and other possible end-of-the-year events.  Though we don't know what the spring events look like yet, we are committed to finding ways to honor you and celebrate you, the wonderful BHS Class of 2020.  
Next week we will be sending out an opportunity for you to give us your input on the design of these events, so compile your thoughts and be on the lookout for a canvas email.  
We want you to continue to take care of yourselves and your families, and of course reach out to BHS staff if and when you need help.  We are, and always will be, here for you!  
  
**Rejection and moving on....** - [https://www.collegedata.com/en/prepare-and-apply/apply-yourself/your-final-answer/rejected-how-to-cope-and-what-to-do/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.collegedata.com/en/prepare-and-apply/apply-yourself/your-final-answer/rejected-how-to-cope-and-what-to-do/&sa=D&ust=1587868095307000&usg=AOvVaw2cT3vI-nyU1EsMYztee4nm)

\*\* Allowance of the tuition credit to be retroactive to the start of the fall 2020 semester for students that may receive certificates after the start of school  
   
**EXTENDED** **- Deadline for BHS Scholarship applications is tomorrow Friday 4/24 IMPORTANT REMINDER - Applications are available online at the BHS homepage under 2020 BHS Scholarship Application.** The deadline for applying for BHS scholarships for students attending ANY college is Friday, April 24.

**SENIORS AND JUNIORS**  
A college counselor from another school district posted a link to a Google sheet that she created, listing information for hundreds of colleges nationwide about virtual tours, info sessions, etc by college.  With her generosity, we have included the link below. It may be of use in directing seniors to find information on some of the colleges they are considering and juniors to find out virtual college visit strategies. If you have Google suite you can access the worksheet through Google docs. Please always check each college’s website for the most up-to-date information.

Westborough HS conducted a College Admissions Webinar where several college admissions professionals answer common questions pertaining to applying to college next year. The Webinar can be accessed here ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHmuHoh5kWg&feature=youtu.be](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DuHmuHoh5kWg%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&sa=D&ust=1587868095307000&usg=AOvVaw0-AFcwd6dXNCRdjc1dTius)).

Read this excellent quick read from an admissions representative at GA Tech. Admissions folks are genuinely understanding of the dilemma that high school juniors are worried about regarding college. This article may hopefully reassure you - [http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2020/04/02/being-seen-this-one-is-for-the-juniors/](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Wen9CPN5QlI5w4xkIzp1fy?domain=pwp.gatech.edu/)

**JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES**  
**PreACT score update** - PreACT score reports are only available in paper format and were delivered to the BHS building which no one has access to at this time. I have contacted ACT and they will be delivering another set of score reports to my home in the next weeks. I will be doing some envelope stuffing at my home and then send out these score reports by mail to student homes. We will also be offering a zoom score report presentation, led by BHS College Counselor Lenny Libenzon, likely during the middle of May – close to the time that score reports should be arriving by mail.  
Thanks for your patience as we develop a new plan with PreACT score distribution.
