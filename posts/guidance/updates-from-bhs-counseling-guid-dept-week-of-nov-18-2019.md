**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS- CARETAKERS  
​**  
As we approach the posting of Quarter 1 grades for BHS students, I have included 2 timely documents from [www.believeperform.com/](http://www.believeperform.com/)   The goals of the BHS Counseling/Guidance department and the school community overall is to encourage students to try their best in school while keeping their stress levels to a healthy level. If you are ever concerned about your student, please reach out to your student’s assigned school counselor.

**SENIORS**  
   
**Important message to seniors who have applied for EA/ED October/November applications – Please try to avoid INCs or need for grade changes for Quarter 1.** The turnaround time for the guidance office to send out all Quarter 1 grades for early appliers is very short before all staff head out for Thanksgiving break in November.  
**Also for students applying Early Decision- It is your responsibility to notify your counselor about your ED contract** and remind the counselor to sign off on your contract. When you hear back with the college ED decision, please also inform your counselor. We cannot send any grades to other colleges until we know your ED contract no longer applies (ie you did not get accepted to your ED school).  
  
Senior students -   
If you've applied to college recently, please note that it takes some time for colleges to process documents. Therefore, even though  
the BHS Guidance Dept has sent all of your documents on time, your common app and college portals might reflect the submission days later. The situation is similar for teacher recommendations too.   
  
  
**All Seniors Seminars have now been offered in your advisories since mid-September. If you missed these advisory overviews, please contact your counselor or Lenny Libenzon, BHS College Counselor – room 279/280, for a copy of the BHS College Application Quick Guide and other important details to help you follow the steps for a successful application process.**  
   
**Transcript release / Teacher-Counselor Recommendation Deadlines**   
To best support every senior in their college admissions process, we require that all seniors meet the deadlines below for communicating to both teacher and counselors re: recommendations.  
**UPDATE**:  If you have college applications with **Dec 1 and Dec 15 deadlines – your transcript release form and other important documents are now overdue**. Counselors and department staff are working hard during and outside of the school day to get your documents ready for these deadlines. **If you got your completed transcript release to your counselor by BHS deadlines and did FERPA and “matching” steps with your Naviance and Common App accounts, then we will meet your deadlines. If you did these steps after BHS deadlines, we will do our best to meet your deadline whenever possible.** Thank you!
