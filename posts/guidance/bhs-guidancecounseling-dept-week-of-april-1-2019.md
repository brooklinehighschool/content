Thank you to everyone who reads these updates from BHS Guidance! Moving forward, all new information and events coming up in the next week will be highlighted in red for easier reading.  
   
**ALL STUDENTS/PARENTS**  
**This Wednesday April 3 is a ½ day for all BHS students. Please see the April 3 schedule on the BHS homepage.**  
   
**Day of Silence - Wednesday, April 3rd**  
On this day, students and staff are invited to stay silent for the whole school day in order to bring attention to the millions of people worldwide who remain silent about their true sexuality and/or gender identity out of fear. This year, the Day of Silence will occur BEFORE Day of Dialogue, so that teachers can more easily discuss Day of Dialogue assemblies after the event.  
  
**Day of Dialogue - Thursday, April 4th**  
On this day, the GSA will sponsor assemblies on a range of LGBTQ issues. Teachers will be able to bring their classes to these assemblies in the auditorium, the MLK room, and will also have the opportunity to hold discussions in their classrooms. ​

**TRANSITIONING TO COLLEGE: EXPERT GUIDANCE AND ADVICE FOR PARENTS OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH ADHD, LEARNING DISABILITIES, AND AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (LEVEL 1)** – see attached flyer for full day parent workshop in Newton, April 6, 2019, Sliding Scale Fee available. This workshop is NOT Public Schools of Brookline affiliated or endorsed.

 **A SURVIVAL GUIDE TO PARENTING TEENS The BHS PTO presents Joani Geltman: Talking to Your Kids About Sexting, Drinking, Drugs, and Other Things that FREAK YOU OUT. April 3, 2019 at 7 pm in the BHS Auditorium**. Joani Geltman, MSW, an expert in child development and parent-teen relationships, returns to Brookline for “A Survival Guide to Parenting Teens.” Using humor and more than 30 years of experience, Geltman shares stories and advice that defuse some of the anxiety parents feel as their children move through tricky developmental milestones. Parents will learn about setting realistic expectations and appropriate limits, social media “do’s and don’t’s,” and how to identify and deal with teen experimentation with sex, vaping, marijuana, and alcohol. Parents will head home with a greater understanding of their teen’s behavior and needs, as well as very practical parenting tools they can begin to use immediately. Please register for this free event.  
  
  
**It's time to think about your summer plans!**   
Please go to the BHS Guidance website for a helpful info sheet for many ideas (updated 1/31/19). Note that programs listed here are not all inclusive and do not suggest that Brookline High specifically endorses any program. Remember to read the intro at the top of the info sheet. See your counselor for more feedback or questions!  
 Some suggested summer pre-college opportunities with financial aid available - [http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/](http://blog.collegegreenlight.com/blog/summer-pre-college-programs-2019/)  
Please note that attending a pre-college program at any particular college does not usually offer any special consideration during future admissions at that school.  
   
**JUNIORS AND SENIORS**  
   
**Understanding College Student Support Services for Students with Learning Differences**:  On Tuesday, April 2rd, at 7 pm in the MLK room, BHS Guidance Department will present a panel of college admission professionals and BHS specialists who will answer your questions about specialized and general supports available at colleges for students with learning differences (including students with IEP, 504 or ICAP plans). This night is geared to  juniors and seniors and their parents/caretakers.  
   
**SENIORS**  
  
**Mark your calendars for MA Educational Financing Authority’s Paying the Bill presentation – Wed April 10, 7pm, BHS Auditorium** - Parents and students are invited to attend a free seminar on understanding financial aid award letters and making a plan to pay the college bill. This seminar is offered through MEFA, the Commonwealth’s authority on planning, saving, and paying for college. An experienced MEFA representative will provide an overview of the college payment process, including the details of financial aid award letters, using payment plans, different financing options, and how to minimize debt. Before the seminar, be sure to visit MEFA’s website — [mefa.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmefa.org&sa=D&ust=1553194361106000&usg=AFQjCNGYqF5L9guIIf19g7eGsqBnriBAEg) — to download a copy of the seminar presentation in English or Spanish and explore other tools and resources to assist you in the college planning process. And make sure to bring your financial aid award letters to the seminar to get all of your questions answered after the presentation.  
   
Interesting opportunity for students heading to college next  year….. **Brookline American Legion Post 11 Multi-Media Scholarship Hackathon on April 7 from 10am-6pm, 386 Washington St Brookline.** During the hackathon, you'll be challenged to make a short multi-media project that supports or highlights the local community. It should be related to the assigned theme, which will be announced at 10:00 AM on the day of the event.  
Use any medium you want. A short video, a website, interviews, maps, a local guidebook - it's all good!   
You can work alone or in teams of up to three. You can form your team ahead of time or seek teammates at the event. You don't have to stay at the event all day - you may come and go to work on your projects. You may win college scholarships for high school seniors and other prizes.  
At 6:00 PM you'll present to our panel of judges. Your presentation should be 3 minutes max. After everyone has presented winners will be announced!
