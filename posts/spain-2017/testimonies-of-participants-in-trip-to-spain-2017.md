​‘’Once in a lifetime experience. I got to see beautiful places and buildings and learn about a different culture’’  
                                                                                    Brittany Grimes  
   
‘’Going to Salamanca gave me a different perspective of the world. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and the host family is also welcoming. I’m happy we were here instead of a big tourist based city, because we got to interact with the Spanish people, not tourist’’  
                                                                                    Max Kerman  
   
   
‘’The culture here is beautiful and completely different. You get to be present instead of constantly feel like you are on the go.  
The food here was so great. I loved trying new things and experience new things.  
The buildings were beautiful like the very old cathedrals  
One of the best things that I enjoyed was when we went to the beach in Asturias. I felt like I was in a movie in Italy. It was absolutely stunning. Que guay!!!’’  
                                                                                    Jalani Mitchell  
   
   
‘’The trip has been a great social experience. I was surprised by the delicious food and the freedom I felt thorough the trip. The school was great and the teachers were the best. The balance between school and social activity was good. I really enjoyed meeting people and getting closer to many of them’’.

‘’I have grown in so many ways on this trip. Not only did I get to experience being immersed into a new culture, I learned how to problem solve in different situations, and I learned how to be present. In Boston, we are always thinking about ‘what’s next?. But here, I have learned to think about how I am feeling and what I am doing in the moment. I will bring this back with me to Boston and I will never forget this amazing experience’’.  
                                                                                    Kaela Flashmen  
   
   
‘’This trip really changed my confidence level in my knowledge of Spanish. Being forced to speak, showed me how much I knew. I love to learn about different places, cultures, and languages. I have created memories and friendships that will last’’.  
                                                                                    Salam Kasu  
   
   
‘’This trip has truly an incredible experience. You can go to Spain by yourself or with family and have the ‘freedom’ that comes along with that but this trip makes you actually live in Spain with a local family rather than just visit and that makes a huge difference’’  
                                                                                    Anonymous  
   
‘’What I enjoyed the most was the scenery. The buildings all looked beautiful and even after 2 weeks walking around Salamanca there is always something new to see everyday. I enjoyed the culture and how welcoming the families were. Also learning to dance salsa and flamenco was so much fun I would have never done it myself but this made me step out of my comfort zone and to be able to meet new people’’.  
                                                                                    Anonymous  
   
   
‘’I am thankful for the lasting frienships I have made through this amazing experience’’  
                                                                                    Esther Gilbert  
   
   
‘’Going on this trip has opened my eyes to a brand new culture and life that I have grown to really enjoy. Living in Spain with a host family for two weeks has made me much more independent and allowed me to meet and be friend so many new people, whom otherwise never would have known existed. I have enjoyed every moment, especially interacting with new people from BHS and Spain’’  
                                                                                    Evelyn Gilbert  
   
   
‘’Since this is my first time out of the country it was amazing to see a brand new culture. I loved immersing myself in the culture. Also I am grateful for the friendships I have made.’’  
                                                                                    Abby Jaynes  
   
   
‘’It was great to learn and go to school without being stressed out. The learning experience was much more enjoyable and productive when my focus wasn’t on what score I would get. Instead I could focus on my speaking skills and immersing myself in the new culture around me.’’  
                                                                                    Penelope Cruz  
   
   
‘’I have grown a lot for such a wonderful experience. It’s amazing to look back at the five years I have spent studying Spanish in the classroom. Now here in Spain is where you realize how all the time you have spent studying has payed off. The fact that I can have a conversation with someone that speaks no English and only ‘’Spanish and really be able to understand is incredible. While being here I had a doctor’s experience and I was able to actually explain to the doctor what I needed and although my grammar wasn’t perfect, he was able to understand.’’  
                                                                                    Olivia Rukenstein  
   
   
‘’This trip to Spain has been an eye opening for me. There is no way I can summarize it on this small piece of paper. Walking through the cobblestone streets each morning and observing the ancient architecture, reminded me how young the United States is. For me one of the most valuable take-aways from this trip was our weekend in Asturias. Standing with my feet in the cold water and looking out onto the ocean made me feel grounded and connected to my heritage. I learnt a lot about myself during these two weeks and experiencing Spanish culture first hand is something I will not forget and I am forever grateful for.’’  
                                                                                    Anonymous  
   
   
‘’I feel like one of the biggest ways I’ve grown as a person as well as a Spanish students, was being in Spain, which is a much more friendly and open culture. It really helped me open to people, some of whom at the beginning of the trip I didn’t know or outright I didn’t like. The amount of community I felt here gave me enough perspective to realize that I didn’t need to judge people, specially before I knew them on a more personal level.’’

My experience in these past two weeks has been like no other. Immersing myself in such a different culture demographically, architecturally, and historically has been one of the most refreshing and nurturing experiences of my life. There are too many highlights to re-count on such a small page, although the overall observation of Spanish lifestyle was spectacular and shocking. The more leisurely and slow/paced lifestyle in Salamanca is so different from the competitive and fast-paced life in Brookline that it made me realize that people live here to live a valuable life and that is just aweing.  
                                                                                    Richie Khazanov  
   
‘’I’ve had a heartwarming experience here in Spain, and I think being able to travel with people I barely know, but knew of, was really eye-opening. It is special to know how I have felt that I have natured/ changed in a way (by experiencing a new culture, a new environment, and different ways of people I would have never expected before this trip  
   
                                                                                    Maddie  
   
‘’Discovering a new culture and different way of life has been on an eye-opening and rewarding experience. I am returning home with an improved knowledge of the Spanish language, the country of Spain and of myself’’  
                                                                                    Grace  
   
‘’I’ve appreciated the relationships. I’ve created through this trip. Many people who I ‘ve never spoken  to before, have become good friends of mine. That’ is one of the best things….I am returning home with’’  
                                                                                    Raven Bogues  
   
‘’One thing that surprised me during this trip was the people. The place was beautiful, with intriguing history and amazing locals, but I was really surprised by how well I connected with people on this trip. I had known of many people and known some people but I never expected to connect with them the way I did. From laughs to secret handshakes to being there for me on a bad day. I really feel like I made trye friends that will last a life time/ Thank you for this memorable experience!’’  
                                                                                    Shira Golan  
   
‘’I honestly don’t know hot I could possibly describe this trip but I will try. First, the beauty of this tremendous city blew me away. I have never seen such ancient structures, and to think that people thousands of years ago walked the same walk, with the same stones in the same places is incredible and difficult to comprehend. Second, I finally felt how rewarding it has been to sit in countless hours of Spanish classes throughout the years. Being immersed in a completely different country, continent and language was an experience like no other. I also think that it woudn’t have been such an amazing experience if it weren’t for our group. We have become like a family, making unforgettable connections that most likely wouldn’t have happened otherwise. Overall, I can truly say that my heart is forever changed for the better’’  
                                                                                    Lena Harris  
   
‘’This trip might have been just a dream. All the euphoria, learning, sights, scenes, new friendships, that one explosive night in the club might just have been imagined. But if it was a dream, it was the best one I’ve ever had’’  
                                                                                    Kris Hernandez  
   
This experience has been so wonderful for me. I don’t even know how to explain it, nor could I do so on this card.  
I’ve learned so much on this trip, and it really re-ignited my love for learning Spanish. This is the first time I’ve used Spanish in real life situations and it’s been amazing.  
I’m also so happy that I got to experience some of Spain. I’ve fallen in love with this country and I know I will be back some day.  
I’m so thankful for all the people I’ve met on this trip, Spanish but specially the people from BHS. Thank you for the experience.
