The ACE (Architecture, Construction and Engineering) Mentor Program of Greater Boston is running this year! The program will start virtually.  
**_ACE of Greater Boston, an affiliate since 2007, offers an after-school program, that runs from October to March, providing students in grades 9-12 with an introduction to the design, engineering and construction disciplines. Students work with mentors throughout the program to development a hypothetical, but realistic, building project. Field trips to construction sites, professional offices, and local colleges are also incorporated into the program. ACE Mentors are full-time architects, engineers, and project managers, as well as dedicated volunteers, excited to inspire the design and construction leaders of the future._**

							Hi,   
I'm sorry I'm SO late to this; looks like the program is almost over for the year. I am interested in exploring this; if too late for 2020-2021, then next year!
