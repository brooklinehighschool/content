     To go to another country without my family was scary. I knew it would not be easy. But when I met my host mom, Sra. Zoila, all my worries went away. I was thousand of miles away from home, but the way Sra. Zoila took me in was as if I were right there with my mom. It was the little things that she did that made me feel all right. From making sure I was not starving to making sure I had enough sleep. I thank her so much for making my experience as comfortable as possible.
