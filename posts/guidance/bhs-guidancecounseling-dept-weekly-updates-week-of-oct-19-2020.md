**Key notes for this week:**

*   **No School for students Gr 9-12 tomorrow, Monday 10/19**. This is a Professional Development Day for all BHS faculty and staff.
*   **Schedule for this week** **will be: Tues 10/20- “Monday schedule” and Wed 10/21 – “Tues schedule”. Thurs and Friday schedules remain the same. 9TH Graders have further nuances to their schedules this week due to staff preparation for a hybrid start on 10/26. Look for emails directly from the OLS administration please.**
*   **Quarter 1 IPR (interim progress report) #2 will be uploaded to both student and parent portals on Monday 10/26 ONLY FOR STUDENTS WHOSE GRADE IS BELOW A C+.** These IPRs offer an excellent opportunity for parents/caregivers to discuss the successes that a student is experiencing with school and provide a morale boost for classes that may not be going smoothly. There continues to be time for students to improve academic work between now and the Quarter 1 end date of 11/6.
*   **Quarter 1 ends on November 6**
*   Target Date for shift to Hybrid Learning – Gr 9 à October 26
*   Target Date for shift to Hybrid Learning – Gr 10-12 à November 9

The BHS “Whom to Call When” and “BHS Student Support Roles” documents are again attached to this email for this week.  
   
**Counselors are doing their best to support EVERY BHS student.** Students should contact their counselor for any questions or concerns – school related, post high school planning related, extracurricular activities related, or life related. **There are now some lags for responses to emails due to the significant number of BHS seniors now applying early to colleges for 11/1 and 11/15 deadlines.** Also – please note that some counselors have access to various phone communication and others do not. We are working on a consistent approach regarding phones, but **it is best to contact any counselor by email if needed.**  
Counselors are working closely with these students for advising and counselor recommendation writing. **If a student issue is urgent, please indicate URGENT in the email heading.** Thanks for your understanding!  
   
Reminder - All NEW UPDATES will be highlighted in BLUE each week for easy scanning of newest info.  
  
**ALL STUDENTS**  
   
**“L” Grade** – The “L” grade occurs if a student makes a course level change within the last ten class periods at the end of a marking period, they will receive an L on their transcript for that term grade in the NEW course.  The “L” stands for late entry. **This policy is particularly important for SENIORS to be aware of since the L grade may appear on transcripts sent to colleges for Term 1.**  
**Any student who thinks they may need to consider a curriculum level change should be talking with their current teacher and counselor during this week of 10/19 to avoid a possible L grade for Quarter 1.**  
   
**New York Times article worth a read for students on managing their own well-being during the pandemic. The ideas are reasonable and easy to do. (Thanks BHS Social Worker Paul Epstein for sharing!)** [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/well/family/teenagers-emotional-well-being-pandemic.html?referringSource=articleShare](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/well/family/teenagers-emotional-well-being-pandemic.html?referringSource%3DarticleShare&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1602946070055000&usg=AOvVaw0EMtMSimS6g0wAivHArfU1)

_Expert Advisory Panel 2 on Support to Address the Whole Child Experience is posting a tip each Monday to support students and caregivers during this time._  
   
**\-- Week #2 10/12/20 tip: Screentime and Bedtime**  
Power down early! To restore healthy sleep habits, make the bedroom a screen-free zone, and have everyone in the family turn off devices an hour before bedtime. If this is not possible, have your children keep a lamp on when using a phone or tablet in bed. Studies show that children have insufficient and poor sleep when they use screens close to bedtime, especially in darkness.    
This week's tip: Breathing Techniques  
\-- **Week #1 10/5/20 tip:** **Certain types of breathing can help calm your nervous system and activate your parasympathetic nervous system**. Try practicing one breathing technique with your children at home once a day. It's good to practice these when calm. Here are some to try out:  
\- **ELEVATOR BREATH** = breathing in when your hand goes up and out when your hand goes down, slowing the speed of the elevator each time.  
\- **2X BREATH** = Breathe IN for 2 count, OUT for 4.    
  Then IN for 3, OUT for 6, Then IN for 4, OUT for 8. See how long you can make your "out" breath.   
\- **5 FINGER BREATHING** = Breathe in as you trace one finger UP with your opposite hand, breath out as you trace it back down.  Repeat for all 5 fingers.   
\- **BOX BREATHING** = Breathe in as you trace your finger up one side of a box, breath out as you go across one side, IN as you go down one side, OUT as you go across.  Tracing 4 lines of a box.  Repeat and slow the speed of your finger and breath.

**What is a BHS coffee talk?** A coffee talk is a time for individuals from the community to talk to students about their career journeys and how they got where they are today. It is a chance for students to network and ask questions about careers they might be interested in themselves. It is a chance to explore different career paths and learn the many ways to achieve future goals after high school! Coffee talks provide students with the opportunity to learn from and create connections with individuals in the fields they are hoping to be in one day.  
  
The **first BHS Coffee Talk** is this week! **Want to learn about construction or how to get into construction management?** Come to the VIRTUAL College and Career Center on **Friday October 23rd from 10:45- 11:20am, X Block**, to hear from **John Marsoobian, owner of Twin Peaks Construction**, and **Jamie Simon, Project Manager at Skanska**, the company working on the BHS renovation!

**Students Taking an AP Course**\-    
If you are not taking an AP course this year and don't plan to take an AP exam this year, please disregard this email.  
The College Board **ordering deadline for all exams is November 13th**.  Any exam ordered after this date will be an additional $40 late fee. Students need to register and pay for their AP exams using our Total Registration website.    
Our AP exam registration period is from:  
**Friday October 2nd - Thursday Nov. 12th.**  Students will register for their exams on Total Registration and pay online using a credit card.   
www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445  
The **cost of each test is $98**, and students can request financial assistance if needed.  
In order to access the new, free online resources provided by the College Board, **all students (and teachers) must also register for their class on the Collegeboard website**.  I've attached a document from the College Board, which outlines the steps for students.   
**Step #1 - Register for your exam via Total Registration**  
   
**Step #2 - Join your AP Class Section, using the College Board Website** (www.myap.collegeboard.org) and use your College Board student account login, as well as your course join code, and fill out the information needed.  (Join codes are given to you via total registration or via your teacher).   
Please let Ms Thomas ([alexia\_thomas@psbmal.org](mailto:alexia_thomas@psbmal.org)) or Ms Kennedy (kate\_kennedy@psbma.org) know if you have questions. If students do not complete both steps, registering and paying on Total Registration and signing up for MyAP on the College Board website, **they cannot order an AP exam** for you.  
   
   
Since BHS could not hold our annual College Fair last spring, we are recommending that seniors attend one of the **NACAC Fall Virtual Fairs. The last virtual fair is offered on =Nov 8.** Please see the attached FAQ for more information and next steps. The BHS counselors have not personally attended these fairs, but wanted to share as many options as possible to our seniors as they are the first to navigate this "next normal" of the college admissions process.
