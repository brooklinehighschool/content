Congratulations to juniors IK A. and Richard D. on their acceptance into the Noonan Scholars Program! The Noonan Scholars Program is dedicated to helping high achieving underrepresented minority students graduate from top colleges and equipping them to succeed post-graduation.   
  
For the next six years, IK and Richard will be provided academic, emotional, career, and networking support. They will also have access to a myriad of scholarships as they proceed to college. Admission to the program is highly competitive, and thus the Scholars program is proud to recognize these two juniors on their accomplishment.
