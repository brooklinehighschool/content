Yesterday, all of the students took a day trip to Zamora from Salamanca which was about an hour long bus ride. It was by far the most incredible destination we've been to so far. The moment we stepped off the bus, it was clearly a different sense than that of the other cities we've been to. Not only was it quite warm with the sun beating down on our faces, but there was a sense of calmness that I had yet to really feel. We began exploring with a walking tour around the more known areas of Zamora, and then were given several hours to split up and explore on our own. As much as I enjoyed the walking tour, my favorite moments were going off on our own in small groups to explore and really take in all the gorgeous scenic views. No matter where we looked, whether it was to the left or right, there was always some sort of incredible view so it was hard to know which way to explore first. The group I went off with began by exploring practically every inch of the castle. I've spent a decent amount of time in Europe previously, however, this location was unlike any place I've been to. The castle had a medieval way about it, including a mote surrounding it and lots of hidden passageways surrounding a large courtyard with ancient staircases. We spent majority of our time here, exploring, as well as simply standing on some of the highest points of the castle just gazing out at the beautiful view of Zamora. The views were clearly awe-inspiring, however, one of my favorite reasons for loving Zamora was the lack of crowding and that sense of calmness/quietness that gave it a much different feel than that of Madrid and Salamanca. This was due in part to the fact that there's simply a smaller population living there, but it was also a perfect time to explore since it was during La Siesta (a time where the locals close shop and give themselves time to rest). To top off the day, we stopped on the way back to the bus at a local bakery to have some some savory pastries. I found myself saying several times, "I am so content right now", and even though I felt the need to say that probably every five minutes, no one argued because it was truly how we all felt. It was by far my favorite day on this incredible journey so far. - Sophia Glazerman
