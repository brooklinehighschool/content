Being a part of AALSP really helped me strengthen my identity as a person of color. I learned skills to help me be more assertive about issues of race, especially when my personal identity was questioned. I also gained experience with public speaking, speech writing, essay writing, history, economy and finances, among other things."<br>- Emily P. '18</span><br><br><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)">"The Scholars Program has been a crucial part of getting me to where I am today. I learned more about my heritage and culture in the past four years being in Scholars than I had my entire school history prior. This program sparked in me a passion and hunger for knowledge and an ability to raise my voice and ask questions. What I had thought would solely be academic support became my home away from home."<br>-Lena H. '18<br><br>"This program really helped me find myself throughout high school. Despite any challenges I was facing academically or socially, scholars was always a safe space with supportive people to be there for me whenever I needed. Scholars class and the scholars office really became a home for me within the high school."<br>- Raven B. '18<br><br>"I am so proud to be a part of AALSP. I feel like I am a part of something important that highlights my worth as a young black woman in America today. Scholars supports my desire to be successful and provides me with a community of people who share similar backgrounds and goals as me. In Scholars I feel like I have a family at Brookline High School where I can joke around and comfortable. I feel like Scholars has my back and being a part of AALSP I know that I can be somebody in this world."<br>- Chynna R. '19<br><br>"Scholars has given me the opportunity for me to thrive at the high school. The teachers who have pushed me in the class have taught me how to grow as a student and most importantly as a person. From learning experiances, challenges, discussed topics, and those around me in the class, I have been able to find myself, understanding how our people have shaped the world, and what it means to be in AALSP."<br>-Jon D. '19<br><br>"Scholars has given me the space to be 100% me. I gained many of the friends that I have now through the program, when I started my freshman year. In addition, I value the history we are taught about our ancestors, as the general history curriculum outside of this program is usually written in the white male’s perspective. After learning, one of my favorite parts are discussing and disputing the facts with my friends in the class. There are just so many perspectives to hear from in terms of mindset, viewpoints and culture. I love how there is curriculum that brings out our voices and differences but still unites us as a program."<br>-Tiara R. '18<br><br>​<br><br>​&nbsp;</span>
