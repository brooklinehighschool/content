                    <font color="#818181">Quarter 1 ends on 11/5. Many students (and staff) are finding this year to be more challenging academically, socially, and emotionally than expected due the shift from remote/hybrid learning to back in-person. School leaders, teachers, student support staff and students are actively discussing and working on how to manage the learning and community building of BHS in a productive, successful, and caring way for all.&nbsp;<br><br>Please note that Monday November 1 will be a BHS Professional Development Day - NO SCHOOL FOR STUDENTS<br><br>If a student has questions/concerns/or just wants to say hello to their counselor, please encourage your student to stop by their counselor’s office when not in class. &nbsp;Gr 10-12 counselors are doing their best to support all of their students. Students should still contact their counselor for any questions or concerns – school related, post high school planning related, extracurricular activities related, or life related. If a counselor is not available when a student stops by their office, PLEASE leave a note or send an email. Counselors are nonstop with meetings in and out of their offices due to the significant number of BHS seniors now applying early to colleges for 11/1 and 11/15 deadlines. They are working closely with these students for advising and counselor recommendation writing. If a student issue is urgent, please indicate URGENT in the email heading. Thanks for your understanding! We’re here and ready to support EVERY BHS student!&nbsp;</font>

Online Exam registration will begin on Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM and end on Mon, Nov 15, 2021 at 11:59 PM. Any student who signs up after this date, is charged a $40 late fee from the College Board.</strong><br><strong>Many students are signing up on the College Board, but not signing up on Total Registration which is where they pay for the exams. STUDENTS MUST COMPLETE BOTH STEPS.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>The AP exam registration process has two steps, but both can be completed in one sitting when the student and parent/guardian do this together.&nbsp;Even if you do not plan to take the AP exam, you need to complete both steps to access the College Board’s AP resources. Both steps must be completed in order to have AP exams ordered:</strong><br><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;Begin the process by registering at&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/tQCNCDkJ8ruXOqYVi5yt5q?domain=user.totalregistration.net">www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445</a>. Here you will indicate both the AP courses you are taking this year and the exams you wish to take. You will receive your join codes and directions to complete the second required step. Any exam fees will be paid online so be sure to have a&nbsp;debit card or credit card available before beginning registration. Paying online is a great way to make sure that payment has been made while avoiding mailing payment.</strong><br><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;Use the join codes provided at the completion of step one to enroll the student's AP courses and exams in the College Board's system.</strong><br><strong>This year each AP exam costs $105.00. Brookline High School would like to support every student in an AP class to take their AP exams. Students requiring financial assistance should contact Alexia Thomas,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:alexia_thomas@psbma.org">alexia_thomas@psbma.org</a>, to learn more.&nbsp;If a student decides not to take an exam they must cancel their exam by&nbsp;November 15th, 2021&nbsp;to get a full refund, students can get a partial refund if they cancel by&nbsp;March 15th, 2021.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Here are the important dates for the registration process:</strong>
