**Entry by Rosa Stern Pait**  
On our first full day in Angers, we visited the Chateau d'Angers, or the Angers Castle. After school in the morning, we took the public tramway to a medieval castle right in the middle of town. It has 17 towers and was built as a fortress in the 14th century by a king of Anjou and then used as a residence in the following centuries. We took a tour of the castle and its well-kept grounds and gardens. Afterward, we visited a tapestry even larger than the Bayeux Tapestry, the Apocalypse Tapestry. It was a fascinating day, and everyone was exhausted by the end of the tour!

Angers is a very cool city. It has a very calm feeling while still offering stores, excitement, and overall city life. Our host families have been wonderful to us. We have spent two nights in Angers thus far and we only have positive things to say!  We even saw a tapestry in a castle!

							Wow, given the architechtual beauty and cultural landscape around Angers, this must have been quite the trip! Was the inside as luxurious as one would expect? And if so how did its architechtual foundation compare to modern day buildings?
