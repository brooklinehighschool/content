The Whipple Writing Fellowship offers Brookline High Students who love the written word an opportunity to develop and expand their skills as writers. The cornerstone of the program is paid summer writing residency. As Fellows, participants join a supportive cohort of fellow aspiring writers, receive a generous stipend to encourage their work, and learn from professional writers from across a spectrum of writing styles on how to craft a piece of writing that will ultimately be presented in a public forum and submitted for publication on our website.  The Whipple Fellows are chosen through an application process in the spring and complete their fellowship by the end of the summer.   
  
In addition to the summer residency, the Fellowship sponsors other writing-focused programming throughout the school year.  For the 2020-2021 school year, BHS students were invited to participate in our BHS Story Hour which focused on the theme of "Navigating Uncertainty".  In addition, we offered an opinion-editorial writing workshop during Spring Break. Recently, the Fellowship has partnered with BHS graduate, Kaya Vadhan ('21) to help publish her student-run _High School Journal of Law and Society_. Information about upcoming opportunities can be found below.
