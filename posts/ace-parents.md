Transparency with Families on Student Progress:
-----------------------------------------------

**Student Led Conferences and Exhibitions:**  
When a student is accepted into the ACE program, families are asked to sign an agreement to come into the school at least 3x a year for student led conferences and exhibitions on their child's progress in the program.  In these student-led presentations, families hear directly from their son/daughter how they are doing in their classes - both their successes and their challenges.  Students are also expected to talk about their progress on their Habits of Success (see explanation on [The ACE Approach](/the-ace-approach.html) page) by furnishing evidence to show progress in at least one "habit" while outlining a plan of action on a "habit" that they need to improve.  In addition to their families, the ACE Program Coordinator or Guidance Counselor and at least one teacher will be present.  At the more formal exhibitions, at least one of their ACE classmates will also be present as a panelist.  All panelists are asked to fill out a feedback form for the student at the end of the presentation. 

﻿Special Events for Families
----------------------------

**Parent Open House Night:**  
In late September or early October, ACE staff host a Parent Open House when parents can learn exactly how the program works, meet the staff, and learn which classes their child is taking and how they will be kept informed of their progress.  They will also learn about important college and career information for their child.    
  
**International Night:**  
ACE celebrates the diverse cultural backgrounds and cultures of its students and families by organizing an International Night each year with a potluck of dishes that families choose to bring in and share.  It is a celebratory evening for families and staff to get to know one another in an informal way and celebrate the rich diversity of our community of families.   
  
**ACE Graduation:**  
Several days prior to the whole BHS graduation, ACE has its own ceremony to honor its graduates and their families.  Students are given individual recognition for their accomplishments by the staff and inspiration words are offered by graduation speakers. This personalized celebration occurs in the Martin Luther King Room.
