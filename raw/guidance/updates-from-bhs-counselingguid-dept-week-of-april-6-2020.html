                    </ul> We know how important it is to engage in healthy and preventative practices to support our emotional well being during this quarantine. One of our BHS social workers suggests…… <strong>If you do reach out for your own outpatient therapy, many insurances are doing away with co-pays for this period of telehealth and phone appointments.&nbsp;</strong><br>Depending on your insurance, there may be no co-pays&nbsp;<strong>from quarantine dates of service (and possibly telehealth appointments after that)</strong>. Take a moment to call your insurance company to check!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>IMPORTANT - The student portal has closed. If you have not completed your elective and wellness course request, you can email your counselor until 4/10 (end of this week) so they can help you with this important task. If you have reached out to your counselor and not heard back yet, we are working on replying to everyone.
