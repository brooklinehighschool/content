Our Program
-----------

Brookline High School offers a competitive gymnastics experience during the winter season. Practices are typically held at Broderick's Gym in Hyde Park two week night evenings and one weekend evening. Previous years have practiced Monday/Wednesday or Monday/Thursday and Sunday evenings. Home meets take place at either Broderick's Gym Hyde Park or their Walpole location.  Transportation to practices and home competitions is not provided.  In 2016-17 BHS formed a cooperative team with Westwood High School to provide a better gymnastics team experience for students from both high schools.  This co-op arrangement is evaluated frequently to be sure that it is right for our community.
