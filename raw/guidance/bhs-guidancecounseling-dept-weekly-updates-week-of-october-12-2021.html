                  <div class="paragraph"><br>The midpoint of Quarter 1 is this week. Teachers are completing mid-quarter IPRs (Interim Progress Reports) for students by this Thurs 10/14 and these IPRs will be shared on student and parent portals this Friday 10/15. These IPRs offer an excellent opportunity for parents/caregivers to discuss the successes that a student is experiencing with school and provide a morale boost for classes that may not be going smoothly. Students can still improve academic work between now and&nbsp;<strong>the Quarter 1 end date of 11/5.</strong> &nbsp;<br><br>If a student has questions/concerns/or just wants to say hello to their counselor, please encourage your student to stop by their counselor’s office when not in class. &nbsp;<strong>Gr 10-12&nbsp;</strong><strong>counselors are doing their best to support all of their students.</strong>&nbsp;Students should still contact their counselor for any questions or concerns – school related, post high school planning related, extracurricular activities related, or life related.<strong>&nbsp;If a counselor is not available when a student stops by their office, PLEASE leave a note or send an email.&nbsp;</strong>Counselors are nonstop with meetings in and out of their offices<strong>&nbsp;due to the significant number of BHS seniors now applying early to colleges for 11/1 and 11/15 deadlines.&nbsp;</strong>They are working closely with these students for advising and counselor recommendation writing.&nbsp;<strong>If a student issue is urgent, please indicate URGENT in the email heading.&nbsp;</strong>Thanks for your understanding!<br><br>We’re here and ready to support EVERY BHS student!</div>

The recording of this event will be shared later this week. Stay tuned!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Registration for the 2022 AP exams-</strong><br>Students at Brookline High School will be registering online. Online Exam registration will begin on Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM and end on Mon, Nov 8, 2021 at 11:59 PM. The AP exam registration process has two steps, but both can be completed in one sitting when the student and parent/guardian do this together.&nbsp;<strong>Even if you do not plan to take the AP exam, you need to complete both steps to access the College Board’s AP resources</strong>. Both steps must be completed in order to have AP exams ordered:<br><strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp;Begin the process by registering at&nbsp;<u>www.TotalRegistration.net/AP/220445</u>. Here you will indicate both the AP courses you are taking this year and the exams you wish to take. You will receive your join codes and directions to complete the second required step. Any exam fees will be paid online so be sure to have a&nbsp;<strong>debit card or credit card available before beginning registration</strong>. Paying online is a great way to make sure that payment has been made while avoiding mailing payment.<br><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;Use the join codes provided at the completion of step one to enroll the student's AP courses and exams in the College Board's system.<br>This year each AP exam costs $105.00. Brookline High School would like to support every student in an AP class to take their AP exams. Students requiring financial assistance should contact Alexia Thomas,&nbsp;<u>alexia_thomas@psbma.org</u>, to learn more.&nbsp;If a student decides not to take an exam they must cancel their exam by&nbsp;<strong>November 15th, 2021</strong>&nbsp;to get a full refund, students can get a partial refund if they cancel by&nbsp;<strong>March 15th, 2021.</strong>&nbsp;<br>Here are the important dates for the registration process:<br>· Mon, Oct 4, 2021 at 5:00 AM - Registration Begins<br>· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 at 11:59 PM - Registrations and payments after this date will incur a $40 late fee per exam.<br>· Mon, Nov 8, 2021 at 11:59 PM - Registration Ends<br>· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 - Registrations that have not been paid for will be cancelled and exams will not be ordered.<br>· Mon, Nov 15, 2021 - Last day to cancel an exam and receive a full refund.<br>Please contact Alexia Thomas,&nbsp;<u>alexia_thomas@psbma.org</u>&nbsp;, if you would like to register for an exam not listed or have any questions.&nbsp; -- Alexia Thomas and Kate Kennedy, AP Exam Coordinators<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Mark your calendars now – Junior Year Timeline and Standardized College Admissions Testing presentation - Thurs</strong><strong>day, October 28, 2021, at 6:30 pm,&nbsp; - BHS Guidance Department with Lenny Libenzon, BHS College Counselor, will go over the Junior Year Calendar, and Drew Heilpern from Summit Educational Group will talk about the different types of standardized tests that our juniors take (SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT, AP). </strong>There will be updates on the ever-evolving testing landscape for college admissions.
