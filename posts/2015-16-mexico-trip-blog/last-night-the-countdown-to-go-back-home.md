After the classes today, the certificates ceremony and packing we honored the students and our experience going out for dinner in the Zocalo. We had the whole balcony in front of the Cortés palace for us. The beautiful night and gorgeous view was a gift for our students and teachers. The night was full of laughter, smiles, hugs and good vibes. Students celebrated their camaradership with joy and we surprised Mr. Méndez with a cake for his coming birthday. Our last night was very fun!  
Long day ahead travelling tomorrow,  but from the evening students will be able to share in person their stories and reflections about their adventures to families and friends.
