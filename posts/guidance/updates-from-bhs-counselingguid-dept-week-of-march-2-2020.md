Check out the incredible amount of offerings in many areas for electives and wellness courses. See you counselor if you have any questions. Keep in mind the required BHS course credits needed for graduation and talk with your parents-caretakers about the best course load balance for you. The student portal will be open from March 3-24 for all Gr 9-11 BHS students to upload their elective and wellness course selections. Be sure students can access their portal now since students only can be uploading these courses to their student portal!

Suicide is a scary topic but we need to continue to be aware of our teenagers’ mental health needs. Please read the short article here:  
https://yourteenmag.com/health/teenager-mental-health/suicide-rates-are-rising  
If you are worried about your student’s mental health (or a student is worried about their friend/family member), please contact one of the school counselors for support and resources both in BHS and in the greater community. Never worry alone!  
   
This is **WEEK B schedule**  
  
**THIS WEEK ON Thurs 3/5 -** Brookline SEPAC and COBAP (Coalition of Brookline Autism Parents) is sponsoring a FREE screening of the documentary **_Autism Goes To College_**  on March 5, 7 pm, VFW Building, 386 Washington St.  
_**Autism Goes to College**_ is a first of its kind film, packed with honest insights for student, parents and educators offering an eye-opening look at what a growing number of neurodiverse students are bringing to campus. From deciding which school will be the best fit, to interactions with professors and peers, facing roommate situations, handling money, homesickness, finding work, overcoming setbacks, staying on track to graduate– these students come up against aspects of college life students typically encounter. See attached flyer for more information  
   
**IF THEY HAD KNOWN** Screening for Parents  
Friday March 13, all juniors will attend an assembly of a powerful documentary called “If They Had Known,” a 35-minute film focusing on the risks of the current party culture and the dangers of mixing alcohol and prescription drugs.   **On Tuesday, March 10 at 7 pm there will be a showing of the film for parents and the community, in the BHS Roberts/Dubbs Auditorium.**   
The documentary depicts a “typical party scene” many of our students have or will attend.   This is not about a student struggling with a serious addiction, but an honest and emotional account of an accidental death that shouldn’t have happened, spoken by his friends and his little brother, all of whom were with him, and who did not react in time.  The goal of this presentation is to help students take seriously the risks of overdose with prescription drugs and alcohol, and to encourage students to intervene and take action to save the life of a friend.  The movie will be followed by Q&A as time allows.  
Consider attending **Northeastern’s Spring Splash program this March**!  
Want to learn about city planning, calligraphy, and aliens, all in one day, for **free**?  We are NEPTUN, an organization at Northeastern University that hosts events inviting high school students (grades 9-12) to campus for **free** classes.

**Every other year, Brookline community partners join Center Communities of Brookline (the event sponsor) to organize a Senior Health Fair.**  This year’s event will be the 2020 Health Expo with a focus on Technology - innovations, resources and opportunities to support older adults.  With an aging population growing faster than ever before, opportunities to highlight and demonstrate innovations for sight, sound, mobility, connectivity and transportation offer such a resoundingly positive experience for older adults in Brookline, as well as those families with older loved ones.   
There may be an opportunity for 10 BHS students come to Wentworth (sometime in March) for a workshop and lunch with their students from different disciplines and attend the June 4 Expo to interact with the other Expo attendees.

**Bill of Rights Institute sponsors the** **2019-2020 We the Students Essay Prompt - What does civil discourse mean to you? DEADLINE APRIL 15, 2020 -** Civil discourse is a concept that goes beyond a simple dictionary definition, and understanding it involves a combination of personal experience and ‘big ideas.’ Perhaps it is something you recognize from an occurrence in your own life. Maybe you can easily recognize when it is missing. Differing perspectives are a key part of learning, of democracies, and of civil society. For this essay, we ask you not only share your comprehension of what civil discourse is meant to be but to also relate what it looks like when it works – and when it doesn’t – and why. Perhaps you will choose to include mention of a time when you, yourself, were part of an exchange intended to understand something – how did you go about it? We encourage you to bring emotion, creativity, specific examples (including current events), and well-researched facts into what you write. A good essay will demonstrate how civil discourse is not just an abstract idea, but is, in fact, action inspired by constitutional principles, and demonstrated through civic virtues. We want to know what you think civil discourse truly means.  
The winners of this year’s contest will receive:  
1st Place – $7,500 and a scholarship to our 2020 Constitutional Academy in Washington, D.C.Runners Up – 5 prizes at $1,500 eachHonorable Mentions – 8 prizes at $500 each[https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://billofrightsinstitute.org/engage/students-programs-events/scholarship/we-the-students-rules-and-regluations/&sa=D&ust=1579225303304000&usg=AOvVaw1GrnQJjZUt5CPBwHWSURZR)
