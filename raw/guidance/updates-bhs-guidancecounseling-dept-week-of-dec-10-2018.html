Students who took this practice test should be receiving an email from the College Board to announce that scores are available and to provide directions for access.&nbsp;College Board accounts should be created by students, so we have no way of knowing their username/passwords. If a student cannot access their account, they should try the "forgot the password" feature first. If that doesn't work, Lenny Libenzon can help students with access when they drop by College-Career Center 279 or his office 280. Last year, issues arose when a student's parents used their own emails to create the account.<br><br>To better understand the information on the score reports, students and parents can view PSAT video -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQGjsOQGpU-">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQGjsOQGpU-</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This <strong>Thursday, 12/13 X block room 020, Mr Libenzon will conduct a quick overview of how to interpret your PSAT scores</strong>.

Legally, these companies can look at up to seven years of internet and social media history, which means&nbsp;<strong>what students are posting today</strong>&nbsp;may be part of a social media audit that could affect their prospective employment opportunities.&nbsp;Join Robin&nbsp;Clebnik, Career Exploration Expert and founder of InternBoston, as she explains exactly what information prospective schools and employers are looking for, as well as how students can use social media to build an authentic,discoverable and informative digital presence.
