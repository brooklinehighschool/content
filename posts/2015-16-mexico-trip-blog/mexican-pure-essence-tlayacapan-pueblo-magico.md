Yesterday was our last excursion to the authentic town of Tlayacapan. Students were able to stroll around the town seeing the locals daily activities, and feeling how life is in a less touristic place. Our visit was calm and peaceful.  
Our Mexican experience is coming to an end, we are trying to savor everything to the fullest before getting back home, the foods, the smells, the slower pace of life, the colors, the differences...  
Today some of us will learn how to cook 'Chiles rellenos' while others continue improving their dancing skills.  
Soon we will leave here quotes from the students reflecting, expressing their impressions on this adventure.  

(function(jQuery) {
function init() { wSlideshow.render({elementID:"887056877892983256",nav:"thumbnails",navLocation:"bottom",captionLocation:"bottom",transition:"fade",autoplay:"0",speed:"5",aspectRatio:"auto",showControls:"true",randomStart:"false",images:\[{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/842633.jpg","width":"400","height":"300"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/9706272.jpg","width":"400","height":"533"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/805943.jpg","width":"400","height":"300"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/7392931.jpg","width":"400","height":"533"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/519562.jpg","width":"400","height":"300"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/8258766.jpg","width":"400","height":"300"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/4674666.jpg","width":"400","height":"533"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/4400505.jpg","width":"400","height":"300"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/8017236.jpg","width":"400","height":"300"},{"url":"8\\/0\\/1\\/5\\/801512\\/181141.jpg","width":400,"height":300,"fullHeight":800,"fullWidth":1066}\]}) }
jQuery ? jQuery(init) : document.observe('dom:loaded', init)
})(window.\_W && \_W.jQuery)

It was fun to hear the laughter and singing in the bus on the way back. These young people know how to get fun from everything.
