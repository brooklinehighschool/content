**ALL STUDENTS**  
**The SWS (BHS School Within a School) admissions process is now open!**  
[SWS Admissions Info Packet](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/NvJgCER6xvcnLn49cNHsz4?domain=docs.google.com)  
Please take the opportunity to see if SWS could be a good fit.  
   
School Within a School, located on the fourth floor of BHS, is an alternative, democratic community for a diverse group of approximately 120 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Goals for students include taking as much responsibility for their education as possible, sharing decision-making in running SWS, and contributing to building a caring community. For 50 years, SWS has provided students with the opportunity to participate actively as leaders in their own educations and develop meaningful relationships with teachers based on mutual respect. Admission to SWS is based on a lottery, the criteria of which are determined by the SWS Town Meeting. In addition to Town Meeting, SWS students take at least two classes in the program, including English. They take the rest of their classes in the mainstream of BHS. More information about the program, and the admissions process, can be found at [swsbrookline.org](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/1cMBCG6Q8xuqkq3YI7B7GC?domain=swsbrookline.org).

You can also reach out to a BHS faculty member (including Darby Neff-Verre – Coordinator of BHS Guidance/Counseling) to start the conversation about how we can help you build strategies or get connected to feel safe and better about your situation.

You might be noticing your child is struggling in new ways, or that old problems are getting worse.**

**Brookline COVID Testing Site - Mondays through Saturdays - Department of Public Health\*\***  
**\*\*UPDATE: testing site and subsidy program for uninsured residents will continue into 2021! Student-facing PSB staff and PSB students in grades 6-12 will have access to weekly asymptomatic testing for 8-10 weeks in early 2021 (stay tuned from an update from PSB).\*\***  
**Where: Public Health building at 11 Pierce St**  
**Who: town residents, Public Schools of Brookline students and teachers, town staff**  
**Test type: PCR swab tests**

**Please contact your healthcare or insurance provider, or MAB if you don't have a provider, if you need further assistance finding a testing center. Whether or not to seek COVID testing should not be a financial decision.**  
   
**Mutual Aid Brookline (MAB) is a community-built and volunteer-run initiative launched in the very first days of the quarantine. We have plenty of remote volunteering opportunities in translation, organizing, delivery dispatch, and fundraising, and in-person volunteering opportunities for grocery/supply/medication and library deliveries.** If you'd like us to match you with a volunteer role, sign up at [https://forms.gle/KjDFcmpPhbRJRu158](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/-To9CpYX2KuymAEkUPr_44?domain=forms.gle) or email [mutualaidbrookline.volunteer@gmail.com](mailto:mutualaidbrookline.volunteer@gmail.com).

**Hotline**  
The MAB hotline is always looking for more volunteers to take shifts! Volunteers are fully remote and can choose shift times according to their schedules. Please email mutualaidbrookline.hotline@gmail.com if you are interested in helping out with the hotline.  
   
**Delivery**  
MAB is particularly looking for remote dispatch volunteers to fill a weekly or every other week five hour shift connecting delivery clients with delivery volunteers (fully remote).

We’re also in need of more delivery drivers (or bikers, or walkers, or cartwheelers)! We have both in-store grocery deliveries (requires going in-store and shopping for clients) and contactless library deliveries (contactless pickup from library of hold materials).

They are a group of high school students who provide free, virtual tutoring sessions to students in Thailand and ESL students in Brookline.
