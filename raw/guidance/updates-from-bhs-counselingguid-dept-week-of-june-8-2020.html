There’s higher demand for the August administration, and importantly, in certain areas, August and September already are full or nearing capacity. Certain states have lower capacity, for August in particular, including Massachusetts (at 75% capacity).</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Please note that more and more schools are becoming test-optional for the next year and beyond. You do have to check with each school for their requirements, as they tend to change.&nbsp; For the complete list of test-optional schools, go to <a href="https://www.fairtest.org/">fairtest.org</a><br>&nbsp;<br>4) Common Application <a href="https://appsupport.commonapp.org/applicantsupport/s/article/What-are-the-2020-2021-Common-Application-essay-prompts">is keeping the same essay prompts for the next year</a>, so you can start working on your essay (remember, 650 word limit). If you or your family have been impacted significantly by COVID-19 pandemic, common app is adding an optional 250-word essay response: <em>“Community disruptions such as Covid-19 and natural disasters can have deep and long-lasting impacts. If you need it, this space is yours to describe those impacts. Colleges care about the effects on your health and well-being, safety, family circumstances, future plans, and education, including access to reliable technology and quiet study spaces.”</em><br>&nbsp;<br>If you need help with the essay, I like <a href="https://www.collegeessayguy.com/">the FREE resources available here.</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>5) Ross Wolfson, the Guidance Coordinator of Westborough HS, conducted two webinars with various college admission representatives to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 on admissions:<br><a href="https://youtu.be/sroeVKSqZtg">Mass State Schools Webinar</a><br><a href="https://youtu.be/uHmuHoh5kWg">Private Schools Webinar</a><br>&nbsp;<br>6) TeenLife's Guide to Online Summer Programs includes several that are eager to enroll students.

It can be found in Naviance, under About Me: Surveys or a paper copy was part of your Junior Seminar packets handed out before the school building closed. Your counselor needs it to complete your college recommendation so please forward a copy of the form to your counselor by email or send them a quick email so they know you’ve finished the form on Naviance.<br>&nbsp;<br>8) Parents of Juniors: We need the Brag Sheet from you!&nbsp; <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6If7_KxeX3jVnVkWDRmLWxUUUk">You can find the form at this link&nbsp;</a><br>Please complete and forward to your junior’s counselor before June 23, if possible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>9) Now is a good time to ask two teachers for a recommendation.&nbsp; Please note that you only need 2 letters. Most colleges will not accept more than 2, and if you ask for more, we can not regulate which letters will go to college and which would not. As you build your college list, you will notice that some colleges only require 1 letter or none at all. These recommendations from both your counselor and teachers will be especially important as we enter into the 2020-21 college application season since this year’s grades and GPA, along many colleges going test-optional, will make recommendations all the more important.<br>&nbsp;<br>10) <strong>RESEARCHING COLLEGES REMOTELY</strong><br>COVID-19 has caused campuses to cancel classes, tours and admitted students days. There is no substitute for visiting a campus while it’s in session, attending a class, and talking to current students. However, there are a lot of online resources available to learn as much as you can in the meantime.&nbsp; It is comforting to know that colleges are being really flexible in their typical expectations and policies during the year of COVID-19.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What you can do now from home:</strong><br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign up for college newsletters and updates<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open every email from the colleges you are interested in and click on the links<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reach out to your admissions officers to establish contact and get any questions you have answered<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attend Upcoming Virtual College Admission Events including tours and information sessions - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOAtzZNAjwxoOQbKzMY2JvMll24LQHBXlpV158qQi0U/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;urp=gmail_link&amp;sle=true">Click on this google doc to view a growing list of colleges </a>who have moved their tours and/or information sessions online in the coming weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact your school counselor via email.
