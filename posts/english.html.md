Our Program
-----------

The BHS English Department serves all BHS students.  Full year courses are offered at two levels of difficulty in all grades; seniors may also choose unleveled courses.  
  
All students must take English throughout their four years at Brookline High School, accumulating a total of four full credits (in proper sequence) to graduate. Students should read course descriptions carefully and attend to teacher recommendations to determine which level of difficulty -- standard, honors, or non-leveled-- suits their needs. Honors level courses require more reading than standard level courses, and texts are often more difficult. Teachers in honors level courses also assume more independence on the part of students, whereas teachers in standard level courses often break assignments down in order to give students more structure and support.  
  
​Senior year, the department offers several non-leveled electives which seek interested students across the academic spectrum. Students at all levels write at least twelve drafted papers a year. Students who choose the most challenging English courses will find themselves prepared for Advanced Placement examinations at the end of their junior or senior years.  
  
Make-up credit for English courses may be obtained by doubling courses the following year or by completing courses in summer school. Seniors wishing to graduate early must complete two full semesters of Senior English and the Senior Paper before leaving school and have the written consent of the English Department Curriculum Coordinator by September 15th of their senior year. Correspondence credit is not granted. Failure to meet the Senior Paper requirement precludes graduation, and the student must take an appropriate summer school course to complete the Senior Paper.

By Year
-------

**​FRESHMAN PROGRAM:** The Freshman Program introduces students to the major literary genres and to reading and writing at the high school level. Both freshman courses offer focused instruction in reading strategies, ample practice in writing and revising, systematic study of grammar and vocabulary, and an emphasis on narrative point of view.  
  
**SOPHOMORE PROGRAM:** Sophomores read traditional and contemporary works from World Literature as they explore identity and culture. Students sharpen their writing and reading skills; they identify and interpret motif, theme, and figurative language in poetry and prose. Sophomore courses include a systematic study of grammar. New sophomore courses introduce more student choice into the English curriculum beginning in 2013-14.  
  
**JUNIOR PROGRAM:** The Junior Program highlights important works in American Literature to explore American culture and point of view. In the spring, students compare two works of literature in the Junior Paper as preparation for their Senior Paper the following year.  
  
**SENIOR PROGRAM:** A variety of year-long courses gives seniors the opportunity to pursue a particular area of interest in English. To gain final English credit, all seniors must successfully complete a Senior Paper related to the content area of their senior course. The Senior Paper is a multi-step process which requires a minimum of 500 pages of independent reading and culminates in an 8-10 page analytic essay.
