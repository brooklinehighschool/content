Hi Everyone, here’s what we discussed in last week’s Legislature meeting and in a supplementary meeting with Faculty Council:

*   Mr. Sedlak introduced a constitutional amendment to discuss voting reform and how bills are presented to the body.
    *   In this proposal, the bill submission process is streamlined, and we discussed the effects of raising the required number of votes to pass a bill to 2/3rds of quorum.
*   We also discussed the issue of T block assemblies sometimes roll\[ing over into X block.
*   We drafted a letter to the administration about the new absence policy that will be in the next Sagamore publication 

  
This past week, some members of Student Council also met with Faculty Council. There, we received teachers’ feedback on recent bill proposals, including our updated headphone bill and a grade transparency bill.  
  
Overall, the majority of the faculty present at the meeting strongly opposed policy allowing additional headphone use -- they believed it would discourage social interaction among students. Although they were willing to allow headphones at picnic tables, they spoke out against the idea of having earbuds during passing times.   
​  
Additionally, the faculty present were against a grade transparency and IPR bill. Many did not want to include letter grades in such IPRs -- some teachers argued that it would only contribute to the competitive BHS environment, while others stated that students should be able to calculate their grades on their own. Despite this, many faculty members seemed to agree with the idea of putting missing assignments on progress reports.
