On Tuesday afternoon the kids divided into groups and three as we asked them to prove to us that they knew their way around Angers. They had two hours to complete a 36-question scavenger in which they were asked about local landmarks and trivia. By design the kids had to ask around for directions, interview locals, etc. And it all had to be captured on film, at least to gain the maximum amount of points. In the end, the scores were very close among the top five teams, but Bailey, Rianna and Simone squeaked out a win one point victory over Jake, Elena and Paget who were half a point ahead of Kerimal, Sofi M. and Dani.
